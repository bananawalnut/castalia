// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// dregg's COMMITTED ROOT PROOF, AS SOMETHING THE ASSEMBLY CAN CONSUME.
//
// ⚑ THE GAP THIS FILE CLOSES, NAMED BY THE LANE THAT FOUND IT. There were two
// halves of "Mina verifies dregg" and each was missing exactly what the other
// had. `DreggProofVerify` consumes a REAL proof end to end and is hash-agnostic
// — but `verifyPlan` threw on `nBatches !== 2` and dregg's root has FOUR PCS
// rounds. `RootFriSlice`/`RootFriUniform` run at the root's real four-round
// geometry — but hard-code `compressBB`/`condSwap`, and `RootFriWalk` prices at
// `BABYBEAR_HASH`. So the 54-slice (now 80-slice) projection prices a
// Pasta-hashed root while the proof actually consumed was a two-round fixture,
// and the real-geometry chain ran at BabyBear prices. Neither half was both.
//
// This module is the bridge: it reads `root_fri_instance.rs`'s emitted object —
// dregg's committed whole-history root proof, four rounds, five matrix heights,
// a 2,746-term DEEP census — into a `DreggProofShape` the generalised assembly
// takes, at EITHER hash.
//
// ⚑ WHAT IS REAL AND WHAT IS RE-HASHED, SAID BEFORE ANY NUMBER IS QUOTED,
// because the honest answer is three-valued and the dishonest one is a headline.
//
//   REAL, at both hashes: the four PCS rounds and their 35 matrices; the five
//   log heights [20, 19, 13, 7, 3] and therefore the mixed-height injection
//   schedule; every opened row (1,511 base lanes a query); every opened
//   evaluation (2,746 extension values); every opening point; the 38 query
//   indices; ζ, α, the FRI α, the 17 βs and the final polynomial; the roll-in
//   schedule. All of it is read off `.fullchain/real-root-fri.json` and none of
//   it is synthesised.
//
//   RE-HASHED, at Pasta ONLY: the MMCS digests — the four round commitments,
//   the 17 commit-phase commitments, and every path sibling. dregg's root
//   commits with Poseidon2-over-BabyBear. A Pasta-hashed root is a RE-MINT
//   (`DreggMinaConfig`), not a re-read, and minting one is a Rust prove run over
//   a 2^20 batch. So `rehash` recomputes the commitments THIS proof's own
//   openings imply under the Pasta suite, deriving each sibling from the
//   BabyBear sibling it stands in for. Nothing is invented — every Pasta digest
//   is a function of the committed proof's own bytes — but it is a re-hash and
//   is labelled one everywhere it is reported.
//
//   ⚠ AND THE COST DOES NOT CARE, WHICH IS THE POINT. Rows are a function of the
//   GEOMETRY — how many lanes are sponged, how many levels are walked, how many
//   DEEP terms are folded — and every one of those is real here. What a re-mint
//   would move is which 19 indices are drawn, and 19 different indices cost the
//   same. What it would ALSO move is the FRI knobs, if the re-mint kept
//   `DreggMinaConfig`'s (`log_blowup = 3`, 38 queries) rather than the root's —
//   that is a different geometry and a different number, and this file does not
//   quote it.

/**
 * ⚑ THE SAME RE-HASH, WRITTEN BACK INTO THE EMITTER'S OWN RECORD — so the
 * SLICED walk can consume a Pasta-hashed root, not only the flat consumer.
 *
 * `rehash` above produces a `RootValues`, which is what `DreggProofVerify` +
 * `RootConsume` take. `RootFriWalk`/`RootFriSlice` take a `RealRootFri` — the
 * emitter's record — so a Pasta braid needs the re-committed digests put back
 * where the walk reads them: the four round commitments, the sixteen
 * commit-phase commitments, and every path sibling of every query.
 *
 * ⚑ WHAT MOVES AND WHAT DOES NOT, and the split is exactly `rehash`'s. The
 * MMCS digests move, because a Pasta-hashed root is a RE-MINT. Nothing else
 * does: every opened row, every opened evaluation, every opening point, the
 * 38 query indices, ζ, α, the FRI α, the 17 βs, the final polynomial
 * and every commit-phase sibling are BabyBear values that `DreggMinaConfig`
 * does not touch — it changes the HASH field and leaves `Val = BabyBear`,
 * `Challenge = EF4` alone.
 *
 * ⚠ AND IT IS A RE-HASH, LABELLED. `kind` is suffixed so a record that has been
 * through here can never be mistaken for one dregg minted. dregg mints no
 * Pasta-hashed root; minting one is a Rust prove run over a 2^20 batch.
