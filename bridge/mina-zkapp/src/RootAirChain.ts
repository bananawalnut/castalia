// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE ROOT AIR AS A CHAIN — 283,527 emitted rows do not fit in a 65,536-row
// Pickles step, so the root's own constraint system is decided by chained steps
// or not at all.
//
// ⚑ THIS IS THE SAME SHAPE OF OBJECT AS §3.20/§3.21 AND ONE THING ABOUT IT IS
// DIFFERENT, WHICH IS THE POINT.
//
// §3.20's chain is ONE walk circuit invoked N times, because all 19 query walks
// are the same shape and 573 compiles is not a thing anyone can do — and it
// MEASURED why: a node process that has compiled FOUR step circuits hangs at the
// first `prove`. The AIR is not like that. Its slices are structurally DIFFERENT
// programs (different nodes, different operands), so a uniform circuit is not
// available without an in-circuit multiplexer over the live set, which is priced
// below and is not close.
//
// What makes that acceptable here and not there: **the AIR is a FIXED program.**
// Its slices are the same slices for every dregg proof that will ever be
// verified, so their verification keys are PROTOCOL CONSTANTS, emitted once —
// not a per-proof cost. A per-query-step VK would have been a per-proof cost,
// which is why §3.20 refused one.
//
// ⚑ AND THE PROCESS WALL IS STILL REAL AND IS NAMED WITH ITS NUMBER. Three
// compiled circuits per process is the ceiling (§3.20's measurement), so a
// single-process chain covers 3 x usable rows and no more. The rest is a
// process-per-slice architecture, priced in the leg and not built here.
//
// ⚑ THE LIVE SET IS WHAT MAKES THIS AFFORDABLE, and it is a property of the DAG
// rather than a design choice: the extractor emits in DFS post-order, so the cut
// width — the number of already-computed values a later node still reads —
// never exceeds 102 across all 10,689 nodes. A boundary therefore
// carries ~100 extension values, not the 1,702 columns.

 * difference. At the deployed 50,000-row budget it is ZERO slices (1,785 both
