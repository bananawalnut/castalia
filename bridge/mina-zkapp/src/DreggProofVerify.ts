// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE ASSEMBLY — `DreggProofVerify`.
//
// ⚑ WHAT IS NEW HERE, AND IT IS NOT A ROW COUNT.
//
// Rungs 1-7 are seven objects, each of which verifies a PIECE of a FRI-STARK
// proof, each measured, each KAT'd. None of them consumes a proof. The inputs
// are synthesised by the measurement: an opened row that no prover produced, a
// fold chain over a value nobody committed to, a transcript whose preamble is a
// stand-in. That is a set of components, and "Mina verifies dregg" is not a
// statement one can make about a set of components.
//
// This module is the one program that takes a proof `p3_uni_stark::prove`
// produced under `DreggStarkConfig` and DECIDES. It is the whole of
// `p3_uni_stark::verify`, with nothing witnessed that the verifier derives:
//
//   1. the STARK preamble — degree bits, the trace commitment, the public
//      values — absorbed, then `alpha` SAMPLED, the quotient commitment
//      absorbed, then `zeta` SAMPLED (`uni-stark/src/verifier.rs:361-390`);
//   2. every claimed out-of-domain evaluation absorbed, in round order, before
//      FRI's own alpha (`two_adic_pcs.rs:780-788`);
//   3. the FRI transcript — alpha, every beta, the arity schedule, the query
//      grind, and every query index DERIVED (`fri/src/verifier.rs:139-270`);
//   4. **the AIR closing equality** at `zeta`:
//      `sum_i alpha^i C_i * Z_H(zeta)^{-1} == quotient(zeta)`, with
//      `quotient(zeta)` recomposed from the opened chunks by Lagrange over the
//      chunk domains, and the three Lagrange selectors computed, not supplied;
//   5. per query — the input-phase MMCS openings under the SAME commitments the
//      transcript absorbed, the DEEP quotient (so the fold chain starts from a
//      value bound to the opened trace rather than one the prover chose), and
//      the fold chain to the final polynomial.
//
// ⚑ THE AIR IS A PARAMETER, AND THAT IS THE HONEST SHAPE. `C_i` for dregg's
// seven ROOT tables is not built and its count `N` is not taken (§3.14) — rung 7
// prices the arithmetic AROUND `C_i` for exactly that reason. So the constraint
// evaluator is an argument here. `minaFixtureConstraints` below is the evaluator
// for the 3-column degree-3 AIR the Rust emitter proves, and at that AIR this
// program is CLOSED: it evaluates the constraints itself and there is no
// residual. Handed dregg's root tables it would be closed too — at a row count
// this file measures and does not pretend to fit.
//
// ⚑ WHAT A ROW COUNT CANNOT SEE, AND WHY THE LEG DOES WHAT IT DOES. §3.15e:
// `Provable.runAndCheck` does not evaluate lookup constraints, and a derived
// variable is indistinguishable from a witness carrying its value to
// `runAndCheck`, to `prove` AND to `getRows()`. So the accompanying leg proves
// with the real Pickles prover, and every "this is derived" claim is backed by a
// ROW-COUNT DELTA against a twin that witnesses it instead.
