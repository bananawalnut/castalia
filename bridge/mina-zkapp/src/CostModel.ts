// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE COST MODEL — one owner for every number the Mina-facing size projections
// ride on, and one mechanism that makes a second owner fail loudly.
//
// ⚑ WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, in the words of the review that asked for it:
//
//   "The lanes did not duplicate EFFORT, they duplicated CONSTANTS — and
//    constants that disagree are worse than effort that overlaps, because they
//    are silent."
//
// Four disagreements were live when this was written, and every one of them
// compiled, type-checked and produced a plausible number:
//
//   1. `deployedShapeOf` forced `logHeight: 22` on every matrix and priced a
//      2,286-term census, while the SAME document's §3.28 measured the root at
//      FIVE heights (20, 19, 13, 7, 3) and a census of 2,746.
//   2. `PartitionSchedule`'s chunk grouping (`misc, fold, open*`) and
//      `DreggProofSchedule`'s (`input, fold, pub, open*, pow`) both feed
//      `rootCommitDigest = Poseidon(digests)` and the only assertion checked the
//      lane TOTAL, so a divergent grouping repriced silently.
//   3. Three prices for "witness and range-check one BabyBear lane", reconciled
//      in a comment in exactly one file.
//   4. `stepBoundary` had an identical signature AND body in two families, so a
//      wrong import was numerically right today and undetectable.
//
// ⚑ EVERY FIGURE BELOW CARRIES ITS PROVENANCE, and the three words are not
// decoration:
//   * MEASURED  — a `getRows()`/`analyzeMethods` reading, or a value read off a
//                 real committed proof. The § or leg says which run.
//   * DERIVED   — arithmetic over MEASURED inputs, with the arithmetic shown.
//   * PROJECTED — a MEASURED unit multiplied by a structural count that has not
//                 itself been emitted. Never quoted in a measurement's voice.
//
// ⚑ AND THE REGISTRY AT THE BOTTOM IS THE POINT. A comment reconciling two
// constants is not a mechanism. `register()` throws when the same named quantity
// is registered twice with different values, and `scripts/cost-model-gate.ts`
// imports every module that registers plus scans the tree for unregistered
// literals. A second owner therefore fails a gate instead of drifting.
