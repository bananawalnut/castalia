// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE UNIFORM WALK — one circuit per POSITION IN A QUERY, not one per slice.
//
// ⚑ THE OBSERVATION THIS IS BUILT ON WAS ALREADY WRITTEN DOWN, AS A CONTRAST.
// `RootAirChain`'s header explains why the AIR needs a verification key per
// slice and says, in passing, that a FRI chain does not — "their chains are ONE
// circuit invoked N times, BECAUSE 38 QUERY WALKS ARE THE SAME SHAPE". Nothing
// drew the consequence, and the deployed walk compiles one `ZkProgram` per slice
// index anyway: `friSliceProgramName(si, …)` bakes `si` into the name,
// `friSliceShape(si)` makes the widths a function of `si`, and `AIR_SLICES + si`
// enters the boundary as a compile-time constant. 1,785 slices, 1,785 compiles,
// 1,785 verification keys.
//
// ⚑ THE HOMOGENEITY IS EXACT, AND IT IS CHECKED HERE RATHER THAN ASSUMED.
// `assertHomogeneous` compares the segment list of every query against query 0
// FIELD BY FIELD, and the lane reads after the per-query shift. Measured at the
// root's real geometry: 41 head segments, then 38 blocks of 571 segments that
// are structurally IDENTICAL and carry the same 1,532,969 modelled rows each.
// Zero mismatches. A geometry change that broke
// that would fail loudly here instead of quietly producing a wrong chain.
//
// ⚑ WHAT MAKES ONE CIRCUIT SERVABLE AT THE REPEATED POSITIONS, AND WHAT PINS IT.
// Three things become witnesses, and each is forced:
//
//   * the STEP INDEX `k`. The head's slices carry it as a compile-time constant
//     (the induction base); a block slice takes it as a private input and
//     asserts `stepBoundary(friCommit, carry, k) == publicInput` AND
//     `predecessor.publicOutput == publicInput`, while the predecessor emitted
//     `..., k_prev + 1`. So `k = k_prev + 1` by collision resistance, inductively
//     from the constant. Exactly `DreggProofPartition.makeChainedProofVerify`.
//   * the QUERY INDEX `q`. It is NOT independently witnessed-and-hoped: the
//     circuit asserts `k == AIR_SLICES + headSlices + q·blockSlices + pos` with
//     `pos` a compile-time constant, so `q` is a function of `k`, and the
//     one-hot over the 38 queries range-checks it. Double-count and skip are
//     therefore impossible for the same reason they are impossible in the
//     deployed chain: `k` is pinned inductively and the terminal seal pins the
//     length.
//   * the TERMINAL BIT. It is not witnessed at all here — the last position of a
//     block emits a seal exactly when `q == numQueries - 1`, and `q` is pinned
//     by `k`. Strictly stronger than the witnessed `isLast` of §3.20.
//
// ⚑ AND THE PREDECESSOR KEY IS STILL PINNED — BY A DIFFERENT MECHANISM, BECAUSE
// A COMPILE-TIME PIN CANNOT CLOSE A RING. The deployed chain pins
// `vk.hash.assertEquals(Field(prevKeyHash))`, a compile-time constant. That
// works for a PATH: slice i is compiled after slice i-1. A uniform block is a
// RING — position 0's predecessor is the head's last slice for q = 0 and the
// block's LAST position for q > 0 — and a ring of compile-time constants has no
// fixed point: position 0 would need the last position's key, which needs
// position 0's. So the key list becomes a MERKLE ROOT carried in the chain, each
// slice proves its predecessor's `vk.hash` at a FIXED LEAF INDEX under that
// root, and the root is anchored where the verifier already looks: the TERMINAL
// SEAL carries it, and the verifier recomputes the seal from the protocol's own
// key list. A prover who substitutes a key list produces a seal that does not
// match. The hole side-loading opens ("a `DynamicProof` circuit makes no
// assertions about the verificationKey used on its own") stays closed, and the
// admissible key at each position is still exactly ONE.
//
// ⚑ ONE PIN STAYS A COMPILE-TIME CONSTANT AND MUST: head slice 0's predecessor
// is AIR slice 6. That is the braid, it is acyclic, and it is untouched.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * The verification-key list is padded to a fixed power of two so the Merkle
 * depth — and therefore every slice's cost — does not move when the plan does.
 *
 * ⚑ 7 → 8, AND IT IS A FLAG DAY. MEASURED 2026-07-31. §3.29's chain was 46
 * programs and fit a depth-7 (128-leaf) tree with room to spare. §3.30's
 * preamble took the head from 3 slices to 88, so the chain is **131 programs**
 * and the terminal `block42` sits at **leaf 130** — outside a 128-leaf tree.
 * Both halves were broken and neither had ever been run:
 *
 *   * out of circuit, `vkTreeRoot` THROWS (`131 programs do not fit a depth-7
 *     key tree`), so `head-anchor-pins --emit` could not have produced a pin
 *     file even holding all 131 keys;
 *   * IN CIRCUIT it does not throw, it ALIASES. `bitsOf` takes `VK_TREE_DEPTH`
 *     low bits, so leaf 130 decomposes to `0100000` — **leaf 2** — and the
 *     position that closes the chain would have pinned head slice 2's key.
 *     `prevLeaf` at a block's position 0 for q > 0 is 130 as well.
 *
 * A depth-7 tree over 131 leaves is not a tight fit, it is the wrong tree. Depth
 * 8 holds 256 and `assertLeavesFit` below refuses the silent truncation rather
 * than leaving the next grower to find it in circuit.
 *
 * ⚑ WHAT RE-EMITS: the path is a private input of every slice
 * (`Provable.Array(Field, VK_TREE_DEPTH)`) and one more Merkle level is emitted,
 * so EVERY verification key in the chain changes — `chainVkRoot` and
 * `terminalVkHash` with them. Nothing held the old ones: `.fullchain/uniform`'s
 * §3.29 keys were already dead to the claim's public-output change, and the
 * claim-carrying ring had never been compiled at all.

 *
 * ⚑ AND THIS IS THE `uniformBoundaryOut` TERMINAL BRANCH, FACTORED, NOT A

 * `airTerminalSeal(friCommit, terminalDigest(acc, out, vkRoot), totalSteps)`

 * exactly, and `DreggHeadAnchor.accOutDigestOf` is that same function. An
 * emitter is expected to CHECK the round trip against `uniformBoundaryOut`
 * rather than trust this comment; `assertOpensTerminalSeal` below is that check.
 *
 * ⚑ WHY THE GATE'S SEAL IS FOUR FIELDS AND A STEP BOUNDARY IS THREE. The last
 * block position emits `Provable.if(isQ[Q-1], seal, step)` — ONE program, ONE
 * verification key, at every query — so a proof of that program at q = 5 is a
 * chain that walked six of nineteen queries carrying the identical claim. The
 * tagged seal drags `chainVkRoot` (the whole key ring) and `totalSteps` (the
 * chain's LENGTH) into the compared field, which is what makes the six-of-
 * nineteen proof unusable under the identical key. Weakening it to make
 * presentation easier would give that proof back.
