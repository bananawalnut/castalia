// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE SCHEDULER — where to cut, and what the cut costs.
//
// ⚑ WHAT THIS EXISTS TO KILL. §3.20 ran the partition and priced a boundary,
// and the price turned out to depend entirely on WHERE the boundary is: 34,566
// rows at a query ENTRY (69.8% of a `max_proofs_verified = 2` step), 762 rows
// INSIDE a query. So the deployed step count was left as a BAND, 564-1,838, with
// the note that "which end you land on is the scheduler `KimchiPartition` names
// as its remainder". A 3.3x spread is the difference between a feasible project
// and an infeasible one, and it is entirely a placement problem. This module is
// the placement.
//
// ⚑ THE OBJECTIVE IS REAL, NOT A HEURISTIC. The carry was measured to be LINEAR
// in the carried lane count at 3.757 rows/lane over a 100x range (§3.20, two
// independent slopes agreeing within 5%), and the pack-and-hash half of it
// separately at 1.258. So "minimise total steps subject to no step exceeding the
// domain" is an optimisation over a measured cost function, and it is solved
// here by a dynamic program rather than approached by a rule of thumb.
//
// ⚑ AND THE MECHANISM THAT MAKES A GOOD SCHEDULE POSSIBLE IS NOT ARITHMETIC.
// A boundary costs 34,566 rows at a query entry because `rootCommitDigest` is a
// digest of ONE flat lane list, so any step that has to re-derive it must
// re-witness ALL 9,103 lanes — including 8,920 lanes of claimed opened
// evaluations that a fold chain never looks at. Chunk the lane list and commit
// to the VECTOR OF CHUNK DIGESTS instead, and a step re-witnesses only the
// chunks it READS plus `m` field elements:
//
//     rootCommitDigest = Poseidon(d_0, ..., d_{m-1}),  d_i = digest of chunk i
//
// The digest is the same kind of object, the boundary is still ONE field, and
// `KimchiPartition.StepPublicInput`'s three slots are unchanged. What changes is
// that a step's carry becomes a function of what it READS instead of what the
// proof CONTAINS. `DreggProofSchedule.ts` builds it and the leg PROVES a chain
// under it; this module schedules against it.
//
// ⚑ THE COST MODEL USES BOTH MEASURED SLOPES, AND THE DISTINCTION MATTERS.
// A lane a step's own work already witnesses and range-checks costs only the
// pack-and-hash rate to fold into a chunk digest (1.258 rows/lane, §3.20's
// `probeNoRc`); a lane a step witnesses ONLY in order to re-derive a digest pays
// the full 3.757, because a re-witnessed lane is unconstrained until it is
// range-checked. Charging 3.757 for both would inflate the deployed count by
// ~6%, and charging 1.258 for both would understate the carry that is the whole
// subject of §3.20.

// ⚑ WHAT §3.21 LEFT OPEN, IN ITS OWN WORDS:
//
//   "The atom model's row figures are §3.19's measured marginals and its
//    aggregate matches §3.19's projection to 0.01%, but a 2.75 x 10^7-row
//    circuit has never been emitted. 591 is a schedule over a measured MODEL,
//    not over an emitted row list."
//   "2.75 x 10^7 is itself a FLOOR (the AIR term in it is the fixture's four
//    constraints, not the root's 1,129). A floor scheduled is still a floor."
//
// Both are closed here, and neither by argument:
//
//  * `deployedProgram` divides TWO aggregates across atoms — `perArith =
//    (deployedQueryWalk - pathLevels * PERM_ROWS) / (layers + 1)` and `tailRows
//    / nTail`. `scripts/emitted-atoms.ts` measures each atom kind as an
//    IN-CONTEXT MARGINAL on the deployed program itself (rows at 16 layers
//    against 15 against 14; at input depth 22 against 21), so every figure below
//    is a difference of two emitted circuits.
//  * the AIR term is leg 13's emission of the root's own 1,129 constraints over
//    10,689 DAG nodes, not the fixture's four.
//
// ⚑ THE LARGEST ATOM MOVED AND THAT IS THE INTERESTING PART. The model's
// `perArith` is 3,221 rows — its "largest indivisible atom, 6.5% of a step",
// the figure that licensed "this is a placement and not a rounding". EMITTED it
// is 2,809, 12.8% lower, because the division charged the fold rounds for a
// residual that is not theirs.
