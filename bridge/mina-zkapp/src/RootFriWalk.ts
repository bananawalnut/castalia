// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// THE ROOT'S FRI WALK AS A SEGMENT LIST — the object the AIR chain's terminal
// seal is braided INTO.
//
// ⚑ WHAT THIS IS FOR. The AIR half is closed at real geometry: seven slices,
// seven processes, all 10,689 DAG nodes and all 1,129 constraints over dregg's
// committed root proof, ending in `airTerminalSeal(dagDigest, digest(acc), 7)` —
// and `acc` is verifier-computable as `Σ_T acc_T · α^(1129 − b_T)`. That seal
// says the AIR's closing equalities hold **at the opened values the chain was
// handed**. It says nothing about whether those opened values are the ones
// dregg committed to. Authenticating them is the FRI walk, and the two halves
// have never been the same chain.
//
// ⚑ AND THE JOIN IS NOT A CONCATENATION. Two chains glued end to end, each
// reading its own copy of the opened values, prove strictly less than either
// looks like it proves: the AIR half folds one set of numbers, the FRI half
// authenticates another, and nothing says they are the same set. The braid is
// therefore built on ONE column commitment. `dagDigest` — the AIR chain's own
// chunked commitment over its 1,702 extension values — is carried across the
// seal into the FRI slices, and every DEEP-quotient term whose `f(z)` the AIR
// legend names is READ OUT OF THOSE CHUNKS rather than witnessed again. A FRI
// half that authenticated different numbers would re-derive a different
// `dagDigest` and the boundary would refuse.
//
// ⚑ WHAT THE AIR LEGEND DOES NOT COVER, MEASURED RATHER THAN ASSUMED. The AIR
// reads only the columns it constrains. Measured against the proof's own opened
// set: **1,288 of the 2,746 opened values (46.9%) are lanes of the AIR chain's
// assignment**, and the other 1,458 — the permutation and quotient openings
// that need their own binding, plus columns the AIR never names — go under a second,
// FRI-side commitment (`friDigest`). Both are in the boundary; only the first is
// shared with the AIR half, and `planOpenedValues` reports the ratio so the
// claim is a number rather than a word.
//
// ⚑ 2,746, NOT 2,286 — AND THE CORRECTION GOES BOTH WAYS. §3.15 prices the DEEP
// quotient at `940·2 + 175·2 + 7·2·4 = 2,286`. Two things are wrong with that
// and they pull in opposite directions. It omits the PERMUTATION round entirely
// (the root's seven instances carry 64 extension permutation columns = 512
// further base terms, all of them opened at two points). And it assumes every
// matrix is opened at TWO points, which the proof refutes: `Const`, `Public`,
// `recompose` and `expose_claim` reference no next-row main or preprocessed
// value, so those matrices are opened at ζ ALONE. The shape is therefore taken
// from the proof's own `inputRounds` and never derived from a table of widths.
//
// ⚑ THE UNIT OF ACCOUNT IS A SEGMENT, AND A CUT MAY ONLY FALL BETWEEN TWO.
// A slice is a contiguous run of segments, exactly as an AIR slice is a
// contiguous run of DAG nodes. Segments are chosen so that every one of them
// fits inside a step domain with room to spare (the widest is 9,600 rows, a
// 128-column DEEP run) and so that the state crossing a cut is small:
// a challenger sponge, a running Merkle digest, a running fold value, and the
// derived challenges. What does NOT cross is the per-query Merkle data — every
// row, path digest and sibling belongs to exactly one segment, and is
// self-authenticating, because the opening it feeds binds it to a commitment
// that IS in the boundary.

 * (`ceil(width / spongeRate)` sponge blocks), the AUX WIDTHS (a Merkle sibling

   * ⚑ WHETHER `segmentWalk` MODELS AND `runSegments` EXECUTES THIS HASH'S

   *
   * The Merkle half of a hash swap is a substitution: `compress`, `condSwap`,
   * a digest width, a sponge rate. The TRANSCRIPT half is a different STATE
   * MACHINE. `DuplexChallenger<BabyBear, 16, 8>` absorbs and squeezes in one
   * field; `MultiField32Challenger<BabyBear, PastaFp, _, 3, 2>` PACKS eight

   * pending base buffer, adds a LENGTH TAG into the capacity, and pops its
   * squeeze queue from the BACK. `segmentWalk`'s emitter models the first and
   * `runSegments` executes it inline; neither knows the second.
   *
   * ⚠ AND THERE IS NO ORACLE FOR THE SECOND ONE TODAY, which is why this is a
   * refusal rather than a lane's afternoon. `RootConsume.rehash` re-commits the
   * root's MMCS digests under a suite — so the Merkle half of a Pasta walk has
   * a twin to check against — but it does NOT re-derive the transcript, and
   * `ROOT_CHALLENGE_STATUS` says the root path CARRIES its challenges. dregg
   * mints no Pasta-hashed root, so a Pasta preamble written here would have
   * nothing to be wrong against: it would compile, prove, and be about a
   * protocol nobody runs. That is the exact shape this directory's own record
   * says its cheap differentials keep catching, so the walk REFUSES BY NAME
   * instead.
   *
   * ⚑ AND THERE IS A THIRD VALUE, WHICH IS THE HONEST ANSWER RATHER THAN A
   * WEAKER REFUSAL. `carried` says: this walk does not derive its transcript at
   * all — FRI's α, the sixteen βs and the nineteen query indices are COMMITTED
   * LANES read into their slots under `friDigest`, exactly as
   * `ROOT_CHALLENGE_STATUS` says the root path already reads them and exactly
   * as the consumer (`DreggProofVerify` + `RootConsume`, `deriveChallenges:
   * false`) already consumes them at BOTH hashes. It is §3.14 residual 1, named,
   * and it is NOT a new hole: the deployed sliced chain's own entering state is
   * a witness too, one permutation earlier in the same argument.
   *
   * What `carried` is NOT is a Pasta preamble, and the reason has TWO parts —
   * said separately because collapsing them into "there is no oracle"
   * overstates one and understates the other.
   *
   *   1. THE EMITTER AND THE EXECUTOR DO NOT EXIST. `challengerRun` below
   *      simulates `DuplexChallenger`'s duplex boundaries and `runSegments`'
   *      `duplex` arm executes `provablePermBounded` — the BabyBear permutation
   *      — inline. `MultiField32Challenger` packs eight lanes into a Pasta cell
   *      to absorb, splits a cell into seven canonical limbs to squeeze, absorbs
   *      a digest natively after flushing the pending base buffer, tags the
   *      capacity with a length and pops its queue from the BACK. That is a
   *      different state machine and nothing here emits or runs it. This part is
   *      plain unbuilt work.
   *   2. THE ROOT-SCALE SCRIPT HAS NO ORACLE. `PastaChallenger` itself DOES have
   *      one — `npm run pasta-verify` replays a Pasta-hashed fixture's whole
   *      transcript against p3's own recorded sponge states, lane by lane, after
   *      every permutation. What has no oracle is the ROOT's batch-STARK
   *      preamble AT PASTA: the observe/sample order over seven instances, the
   *      25 public values, the 64 cumulative sums, the 2,630 opened values, and
   *      the ζ and LogUp challenges it must reproduce. dregg mints no
   *      Pasta-hashed ROOT, so that script would be checked against nothing.
   *
   * So a Pasta preamble is not unmodellable; it is unbuilt AND unchecked at the
   * shape that matters. Until it is both, the honest chain carries.
   *
   * ⚠ WHAT A `carried` WALK THEREFORE DOES NOT SUPPORT: a preamble. `preamble`
   * and `carried` together is refused below, because the preamble IS the
   * derivation this value says is absent.

/**
 * **THE PLANNER.** Greedy-maximal slices under a row budget, exactly as
 * `planRootAirChain` cuts the AIR: extend while work + carry fits, then cut.
 *
 * ⚑ THE GREEDY CHOICE IS MEASURED HERE, NOT INHERITED. This planner took
 * `planRootAirChain`'s shape AND its justification — "there is no such cliff
 * here" — which was established for the AIR DAG's carry, bounded by a cut width
 * of 102, and is NOT established for this walk, whose carry spread is 6.5x.
 * `npm run cost-gate` phase [5] runs a dynamic program over this exact carry
 * function: at the deployed 50,000-row budget both give **839 slices**, and the
 * DP recovers 260,065 rows of carry (2.8%) at the same count. So greedy costs
 * nothing in slices at this budget — which is a measurement, and it is the
 * reason to keep the greedy planner rather than the borrowed sentence.
 *
 * The carry is recomputed at every candidate end because it is a function of
 * the CUT rather than of the slice's length — a boundary that falls inside a
 * DEEP run carries five height accumulators and their `alpha_pow`s; one that
 * falls between two queries carries almost nothing but the derived challenges.
 * That spread is the whole reason a boundary here is not a constant, and §3.20
 * measured its two ends at 34,566 and 762 rows.
