// THE COST-MODEL GATE.
//
// ⚑ WHAT IT IS FOR, in the words of the review that asked for it: the constants
// that disagreed were SILENT, and "a comment reconciling them in one place is
// not a mechanism". This is the mechanism. Four phases:
//
//   [1] REGISTRY — every module that owns a cost constant is imported, and
//       `CostModel.register` throws if two of them register the same named
//       quantity with different values. A clash is a crash at import.
//   [2] GEOMETRY — the recorded census and heights are re-derived from the real
//       committed proof, so `MEASURED_ROOT_GEOMETRY` is a measurement with a
//       ratchet rather than a number transcribed from a document.
//   [3] THE HEADLINE — the deployed and Pasta row counts re-derived from the
//       MEASURED segment list at the MEASURED geometry, against the retired
//       flat-height / 2,286-term figures they replace.
//   [4] SOURCE SCAN — a registered constant's literal appearing in a file that
//       does not import the owner is a second home waiting to drift, and a
//       RETIRED figure appearing anywhere outside a correction is a stale
//       number still being quoted. Both fail.
//
// `npm run cost-gate`.
