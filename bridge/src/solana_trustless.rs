//! `dregg-bridge::solana_trustless`: the **trustless** inbound proof-of-lock for
//! the Solana `$DREGG` mirror — the honest upgrade from the trusted-oracle
//! attestation in [`crate::solana_mirror`].
//!
//! See `docs/deos/TRUSTLESS-SOLANA-BRIDGE.md` for the full design (Option A vs B,
//! the recommendation, the migration). The short of it:
//!
//! Today [`crate::solana_mirror::MirrorState::mint_against_lock`] trusts a
//! threshold [`crate::midnight::FederationAttestation`] that the Solana lock
//! happened. This module replaces that trusted *word* with a verifiable
//! *proof-of-lock* — a [`SolanaLockProof`] carrying Solana consensus evidence +
//! an account-inclusion proof — verified by [`verify_lock_proof_consensus`] and
//! routed through the SAME conservation accounting
//! ([`crate::solana_mirror::MirrorState::credit_lock`]) as the trusted path.
//!
//! # What is real vs. what is the remaining adapter layer
//!
//! The consensus verification is **no longer a stub.** It is the real
//! cryptographic check in [`crate::solana_consensus`]:
//!
//! - **Real (REACHES [`LockProofTrust::ConsensusVerified`]):** given a tracked
//!   per-epoch [`EpochStakeTable`], [`verify_lock_proof_consensus`] verifies that
//!   ≥ 2/3 of the epoch's active stake validly voted the claimed `bank_hash` at
//!   the claimed slot (real per-vote Ed25519 + stake-weighted sum + duplicate
//!   collapse), that the `bank_hash` recomputes from its committed components
//!   (binding the accounts hash + PoH tail to what was voted), that the vault
//!   account's lock record is included in that accounts hash (domain-separated
//!   sorted Merkle), and — when present — that the PoH tick chain links the
//!   slot's blockhash to a verified anchor.
//! - **Real (structural, [`LockProofTrust::StructureOnly`]):** [`verify_lock_proof`]
//!   checks proof structure + binding (well-formedness, the claim fields match
//!   the mirror config and the included record) and a *claimed-tally* sanity
//!   check, WITHOUT a stake table. It can never reach `ConsensusVerified`.
//! - **Remaining adapter layer (honest):** the cryptography and consensus
//!   arithmetic are real, but the mainnet **wire-format ingestion** is not yet
//!   reproduced — parsing real vote `Transaction`s into [`ValidatorVote`]s,
//!   sourcing/rotating the [`EpochStakeTable`] from Solana's stake program, the
//!   exact accounts-hash fan-out/preimage, and a bounded/recursive PoH anchor
//!   policy. See [`crate::solana_consensus`] for the precise modeled-vs-mainnet
//!   boundary.
//!
//! The [`LockProofTrust`] dial tells the caller exactly which level a given
//! verification achieved, so the structural check can never be mistaken for the
//! consensus check.
