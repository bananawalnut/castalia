//! **Install the verified-Lean settlement gate this surface's market actually needs — at STARTUP.**
//!
//! # What was broken
//!
//! `dreggnet-web` serves a sealed-bid market (`/offerings/market/session/{id}`, and the Dark
//! Bazaar beside it). A settle folds the award ring through
//! [`dregg_intent::verified_settle::settle_ring_verified`], which is FAIL-CLOSED by design: with no
//! [`IntentVerifiedGate`](dregg_intent::verified_gate::IntentVerifiedGate) registered it REFUSES
//! rather than letting an unverified in-process Rust fold decide a settlement. That refusal is
//! correct and stays.
//!
//! What was NOT correct is that nothing in this crate ever registered the gate. Measured on
//! 2026-07-25 against the shipped router, a player could `list`, `bid`, `bid` — three real
//! committed turns — and then the one turn that matters died with:
//!
//! ```text
//! Refused: settlement rejected by the verified executor: award settlement rejected by the
//! verified executor: verified-executor FFI unavailable: no verified gate registered
//! ```
//!
//! `dregg_exec_lean::register_distributed_gates()` had exactly ONE caller in the whole repo (a
//! `dreggnet-catalog` test). So the sealed auction was unreachable in `dreggnet-web-server`: a
//! button that lands two turns and then cannot complete the third.
//!
//! # Why REGISTER rather than hide the affordance
//!
//! `dregg-exec-lean` is **already compiled and linked into this binary** — `spween-dregg` and
//! `dreggnet-telegram` both pull `dregg-sdk`, whose default features include `exec-lean`, and
//! `dregg-automatafl` + `dregg-bridge` already link `dregg-lean-ffi` (the archive) unconditionally.
//! So there was never a link-weight or portability argument for the absence: the verified executor
//! is in the process, and the only thing missing was the four-line call that hands it to the four
//! FFI-free coordination seams. Naming `dregg-exec-lean` as a direct dependency adds ZERO new
//! compilation; it makes an already-present capability reachable.
//!
//! # Fail closed, LOUDLY, at startup
//!
//! Registration alone is not evidence: a registered gate over an ABSENT or STALE Lean archive still
//! refuses at the third click, which is the failure mode this module exists to delete. So
//! [`install_verified_settlement_gate`] registers and then **PROVES the gate decides**, with a
//! two-polarity probe run once at startup:
//!
//!   * a funded, distinct, live-cell leg MUST commit and MUST produce the exact post-column;
//!   * an UNDER-FUNDED leg MUST be rejected.
//!
//! The second pole is what makes this a gate rather than a smoke test: a gate that answered "ok"
//! unconditionally would sail through the first probe. `dreggnet-web-server` runs this before it
//! binds a listener and REFUSES TO BOOT on failure (the same posture
//! `validate_public_shielded_deployment` takes), so an operator learns at second zero, not from a
//! player's third click.

    // `dregg-cell` is a pervasive dependency and a plain `not(test)` refusal would have refused
    // valid turns across every debug test build in the workspace, so release-gating it is right.
