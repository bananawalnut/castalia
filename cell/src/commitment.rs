//! Canonical state-commitment for a `Cell`.
//!
//! ## Background (audit P0-2)
//!
//! Prior to this module, the codebase had **three** disjoint state-commitment
//! schemes with no cross-binding:
//!
//! 1. `Cell::state_commitment()` — BLAKE3, `dregg-cell-state-v1` derive key,
//!    committed to a **subset** of state (no visibility, no commitments, no
//!    delegation/program/proved_state).
//! 2. `Ledger::hash_cell()` — BLAKE3, `dregg-cell:merkle-leaf v2` derive key,
//!    committed to a **superset** (all of `state_commitment` plus visibility,
//!    commitments, delegation_epoch, proved_state, program, delegate, delegation).
//! 3. `circuit::CellState::compute_commitment()` — Poseidon2 over BabyBear,
//!    committed to **only** `(balance, nonce, fields[0..STATE_SLOTS], capability_root)`,
//!    omitting identity, permissions, VK, etc.
//!
//! The trust gap: a sovereign cell's circuit-side identity had no binding
//! to its permissions or verification key. Two cells with identical
//! `(balance, nonce, fields, cap_root)` but completely different `Permissions`
//! produced the same circuit-side commitment.
//!
//! ## Resolution
//!
//! All authority-bearing state goes through a **single** canonical commitment
//! function: [`compute_canonical_state_commitment`]. Both `Cell::state_commitment`
//! and `Ledger::hash_cell` are now thin wrappers calling this function, so they
//! produce **identical bytes** for the same state.
//!
//! For the circuit (Poseidon2) side, the field shape is incompatible with the
//! BLAKE3 scheme. The right binding is to use this function's output as a
//! BabyBear public input on the circuit side — i.e. the STARK's `state_commit`
//! public input must be derived from the canonical commitment, not invented
//! independently. See [`canonical_to_babybear_nonet`] for the bytes-to-felts
//! adapter.
//!
//! REVIEW[circuit-fix-coordination]: The circuit's `CellState::compute_commitment`
//! (in `circuit/src/effect_vm.rs`) still commits to a strict subset. To close
//! P0-2 fully, the circuit AIR's state_commit boundary public input should be
//! constrained to equal the BabyBear-field encoding of the canonical commitment.
//! A coordinating change in `circuit/` should introduce a
//! `bind_to_canonical_commitment(canonical_bytes)` adapter that asserts equality
//! between the Poseidon2 inner commitment and `canonical_to_babybear_nonet(bytes)`,
//! or replace the Poseidon2 commitment with the canonical scheme entirely.

/// Domain-separation context for the canonical state commitment.
///
/// **Versioning policy:** any change to this module's hash shape MUST bump the
/// version suffix. Downstream Merkle leaves, sovereign commitments, and
/// circuit public inputs derive their domain separation transitively from this
/// context — bumping it cleanly invalidates stale commitments rather than
/// allowing silent cross-version collisions.
///
/// `v4 → v5` (cap Phase A): the absorbed `capability_root` is now the openable
/// sorted-Poseidon2 Merkle root (a BabyBear felt's 4 LE bytes), computed
/// identically to the EffectVM circuit's `cap_root`, replacing the old
/// disjoint BLAKE3 XOR-fold. The bump cleanly invalidates any stale v4
/// commitment rather than risking a silent cross-version collision.
///
/// `v5 → v6` (THE EPOCH §5, signed wells): the balance is now a SIGNED i64
/// committed via the order-preserving biased two-limb encoding
/// ([`crate::state::encode_balance_le`] — `biased = bits(balance) ⊕ 2^63`,
/// LE), replacing the raw `u64::to_le_bytes`. Issuer wells legitimately
/// commit negative balances (−supply); the range-table limb shape `(lo, hi)`
/// is [`crate::state::balance_limbs`]. Rides the epoch's one
/// VK/commitment flag-day.
///
/// `v6 → v7` (`.docs-history-noclaude/UNIVERSAL-MAP-ROTATION.md` §2.4): add the `heap_root`
/// register as a canonical commitment limb — the openable sorted-Poseidon2
/// root of the cell's `(collection, key) → value` heap (`circuit::heap_root`).
/// A legacy (no-heap-activity) cell contributes the fixed `empty_heap_root()`
/// constant, so the absorption is a uniform no-op for legacy cells.
/// `v7 → v8` (`.docs-history-noclaude/UNIVERSAL-MAP-ROTATION.md` §2.6): add the `committed_height`
/// scalar as a canonical commitment limb — the PI v3 committed-height column's
/// commitment face. A legacy (never-committed) cell contributes 0, so the
/// absorption is a uniform no-op for legacy cells.
/// `v8 → v9` (cap crown — the REVOKE tombstone reconciliation): the absorbed
/// `capability_root` is now the TOMBSTONE-deletion root (a revoked slot leaves a
/// ZERO/padding leaf at its sorted position rather than a compacted rebuild),
/// matching the in-circuit sel-24 revoke gate byte-for-byte. The cap-root value
/// changes for any cell that has revoked, so the cell commitment that absorbs it
/// must bump in lockstep (the coupled CAP_ROOT + COMMITMENT flag-day per the
/// cap-crown rule) so stale compacted roots cleanly invalidate. A never-revoked
/// cell's cap-root — and therefore its commitment — is byte-unchanged; the bump
/// is a uniform no-op for them, it just re-domain-separates so no stale
/// post-revoke commitment can collide cross-version.
///
/// `v9 → v10` (hybrid authorization): absorb the cell-owned ML-DSA key
/// commitment and its dedicated key epoch.  This is the durable authorization
/// anchor checked against the raw key carried by a signed turn; it must move the
/// ledger root independently of capability-snapshot `delegation_epoch`.
///
/// `v10 → v11` (exact fields root): the `fields_root` limb now commits the
/// raw numeric `u64` key and all 32 value bytes through canonical `u16` limbs
/// before Poseidon2 compression.  This removes the old zero-work `+p` aliases
/// in both `field_key_hash` and the single-felt value fold.  The eight-felt
/// carrier geometry is unchanged, but every fields root and its dependent
/// state/ledger commitment belongs to a new re-genesis epoch.
///
/// NB — this `v10` is the BLAKE3 *context-string* version (an axis that has
/// counted v1→v9 over the commitment's history); it is ORTHOGONAL to the
/// rotated-Poseidon2 commitment's `V9_*` constants below (which name the
/// 24-register rotation "generation 9", not this string). The rotated
/// commitment AUTOMATICALLY reflects the tombstone change because its cap-root
/// limb (`compute_rotated_pre_limbs`, limb 25) calls the SAME
/// `compute_canonical_capability_root_felt`, which now tombstones.
///
/// NB — a rotated leg's `vk_hash` IS a structural commitment: it is the blake3 of
/// the accepting cohort descriptor's committed JSON (or, for a derived welded
/// member, of its canonical bytes), so it moves when the constraint set moves. It
/// still does not need a tombstone bump here: the cryptographic invalidation of
/// stale post-revoke roots is enforced by the changed cap-root VALUE flowing into
/// this commitment's PI face, not by a VK change.
///
/// (This note used to cite `dregg_verifier::EFFECT_VM_VK_HASH_HEX` as "a hash of
/// the AIR *name*". That constant was DELETED 2026-08-05 along with the v1 verifier

///
/// The v8 BLAKE3 commitment ([`compute_canonical_state_commitment`]) binds the cell's FULL
/// authority-bearing state: identity (`id`/`public_key`/`token_id`), `mode`, the eight
/// `Permissions` fields, the `verification_key`, `delegate`, the `delegation` snapshot, the
/// `program`, and the CellState authority sub-state (`field_visibility`, `commitments`,
/// `proved_state`, `swiss_table_root`, `refcount_table_root`, `fields_root`,
/// `system_roots_digest`, all 16 `fields`). The rotated v9 commitment's NAMED limbs cover
/// only a SUBSET of this: balance/nonce (r0/r1/r2), `fields[0..8]` (r3..r10), `cap_root`
/// (r25), `nullifier_root`/`commitments_root`/`heap_root` (r26/r27/r28), `lifecycle`/`epoch`/`committed_height`
/// (r28/r29/r30). Everything else — permissions, VK, delegate, delegation, program, mode,
/// token_id, the visibility/commitment/proved/side-table sub-roots, and `fields[8..16]` —
/// would be DROPPED by a rotated commitment that left the app-register headroom zeroed.
///
/// Dropping authority state is a soundness hole (two cells with identical
/// balance/nonce/fields[0..8]/roots but DIFFERENT permissions or VK would commit identically,
/// so a verifier could not tell a locked-down cell from a wide-open one). To close it, the
/// rotated commitment binds this digest into register **r23** (the last app register; the
/// Lean welds `EffectVmEmitRotationV3.weldsAt` constrain only r0..r10 + cap_root, so r23 is a
/// freely-witnessed limb that the anti-ghost keystone `wireCommitR_binds` /
/// `rotatedCommit_binds_reg` ALREADY binds — no Lean change is needed; r23 is "just a
/// register" the commitment proves bound). The digest is computed cell-locally, so both the
/// cell-side v9 commitment and the producer ([`dregg_turn::rotation_witness::produce`]) build
/// the SAME r23 from the SAME `&Cell`, and the circuit trace carries it on the wire.
///
/// ## What it folds (the authority residue not on a named limb)
///
/// This walks the SAME byte serialization v8 uses for these fields (so v8 and v9 agree on
/// "what is authority state"): identity, mode, permissions, VK, delegate, delegation,
/// program, and the CellState authority sub-state that no named limb carries —
/// `field_visibility`, `commitments`, `proved_state`, `swiss_table_root`,
