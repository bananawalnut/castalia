//! Refusal gate for the UNAUDITED post-quantum fallback path.
//!
//! # The hole this closes
//!
//! `dregg-pq` is a LIGHT leaf: it never links the 546 MB Lean archive. The
//! Lean-verified ML-DSA / ML-KEM cores are INJECTED as `fn` pointers by a host
//! that *can* link it (see `install_verified_mldsa_verify_core` and friends).
//! Until such a host installs them, every operation in this crate is answered by
//! the `fips204` 0.4 / `ml-kem` 0.2.3 RustCrypto crates — which are NOT audited
//! and are NOT the proven objects this project's assurance claims rest on.
//!
//! That fallback used to be SILENT. The failure mode it produced is the worst
//! one available to us: nothing errors, every signature still verifies, every
//! handshake still completes, the build is green — and the accept/reject
//! authority in the deployed binary is code nobody audited. It is reached by
//! ordinary accidents, not by sabotage:
//!
//!   * a stale or incomplete `dregg-lean-ffi/libdregg_lean.a` seed can omit one
//!     or more of the six PQ cores, so a FRESH CLONE takes this path;
//!   * `dregg-lean-ffi`'s build script degrades to that seed on a `lake build`
//!     failure, a `leanc` failure, or a splice failure — each reported only as a
//!     `cargo:warning=`, which cargo hides for dependency build scripts;
//!   * a host binary that simply never calls the install functions.
//!
//! In all three the process runs unaudited crypto with no signal at all.
//!
//! # The mechanism, and why this one
//!
//! Reaching an unaudited primitive is FATAL unless the operator has explicitly
//! accepted it by setting `DREGG_ALLOW_UNAUDITED_PQ=1`.
//!
//! * **Why not fail the build/link?** Impossible in principle *here*. `dregg-pq`
//!   does not link the archive; whether a host will install verified cores is
//!   unknowable at this crate's compile time. The build-time half of this gate
//!   therefore lives where the archive IS linked — `dregg-lean-ffi`'s build
//!   script, which nm-probes the final archive for the six core exports and
//!   fails the build when they are missing. The two halves are complementary:
//!   that one catches a bad ARTIFACT, this one catches a host that never
//!   installed (or a call that beat the install).
//!
//! * **Why `abort()` and not `panic!`?** A panic is CATCHABLE, and in exactly the
//!   deployed shape we care about it gets swallowed: a `tokio` task panic kills
//!   only that task, so a serving node would log one backtrace per request and
//!   keep answering — quiet substitution restored, with extra steps. Likewise
//!   `catch_unwind`, and `panic = "abort"` is not something a leaf can assume.
//!   `process::abort()` cannot be caught, cannot be unwound past, and cannot be
//!   swallowed by a task boundary. The message goes to stderr directly (not
//!   through `log`/`tracing`, which may be unconfigured or filtered at startup)
//!   — and "directly" now means a raw write to FILE DESCRIPTOR 2, not `eprintln!`.
//!   `eprintln!` goes through `std::io::stderr()`, which honours
//!   `std::io::set_output_capture`, which is what libtest installs around every
//!   test — so under `cargo test` the banner landed in a per-test capture buffer
//!   that `abort()` never flushes, and the refusal was a bare SIGABRT with no
//!   output. See [`eprintln_fd2`].
//!
//! * **Why an env opt-in rather than unconditional refusal?** An unconditional
//!   refusal would break legitimate work that has no verified core available and
//!   does not claim assurance: this crate's own fallback unit tests, differential
//!   KATs that deliberately drive the crate path, and non-PQ / marshal-only
//!   builds. The opt-in keeps those possible while making the DEFAULT the safe
//!   one — absence of the variable is fatal, so nobody reaches unaudited crypto
//!   by inaction. Opting in is a deliberate, greppable, auditable act that also
//!   prints a warning on first use.
//!
//! # ⚑ THE DECLARED-BYPASS DISCIPLINE (the residual this gate still had)
//!
//! Everything above was already true and already tested (`tests/unaudited_refusal.rs`
//! drives the abort as a real subprocess on four arms). Three things were NOT:
//!
//!   1. **`DREGG_ALLOW_UNAUDITED_PQ=1` was IRREVOCABLE.** The tree-wide "I demand
//!      the verified artifact" switch — `DREGG_REQUIRE_LEAN=1`, which
//!      `turn::require_verified_conservation_gate`, `node::finality_gate` and
//!      `node::coord_gate` all honour by revoking their declared bypasses — had **no
//!      effect on any PQ path at all**. An operator could demand the verified
//!      artifact and still have the unaudited `fips204` crate deciding
//!      accept/reject. [`unaudited_pq_bypass_allowed`] now makes it revoke the
//!      opt-in, so the two switches cannot contradict each other silently.
//!   2. **The bypass was UNREGISTERED.** No row in
//!      `scripts/ci-invariants/gate-dataflow.tsv`, so invariant 6 never looked at
//!      the PQ sites. It is registered now, at the named
//!      `mldsa::mldsa_verify_disposition` (twin#13).
//!   3. **The provenance was ONE process-global warning.** `warn_once_permitted`
//!      fires once, for the whole process, naming no operation — so an operator
//!      could not tell WHICH of the six PQ directions the unaudited crate answered,
//!      or how often. [`PqSite`] + [`pq_provenance`] now count both answers per
//!      site (verified core vs unaudited crate) and warn once PER SITE.
//!
//! This crate stays a light leaf: it exports the COUNTERS, and a host that has a
//! metrics recorder (`node::metrics::publish_pq_provenance`) turns them into
//! Prometheus series.

              a correct archive is produced by dregg-lean-ffi's build script. Check:\n\
                nm -g --defined-only <archive> | grep -E \
                  'dregg_(fips204_(verify|sign)_real|mldsa_keygen_real|mlkem_(keygen|encaps|decaps)_real)'\n\
           2. dregg-lean-ffi's build script degraded to that seed (a `lake build`,\n\
              `leanc`, or archive-splice failure). Cargo HIDES dependency build-script\n\
              warnings; re-run with `cargo build -vv` to see them.\n\
           3. This binary never calls the install functions at startup.\n\
         \n\
         TO PROCEED ANYWAY (accepting UNAUDITED crypto, and forfeiting every assurance\n\
         claim that depends on the verified cores) set:\n\
           {ALLOW_UNAUDITED_PQ_ENV}=1\n\
         Do NOT set it in production, in a validator, or in anything whose output is\n\

/// `tests/unaudited_refusal.rs`
/// spawns a genuine subprocess with no core installed and no opt-in, and asserts
/// the abort actually happens with the naming message. The override lets the
/// tests that are about KEM/DSA BEHAVIOUR run; the subprocess test covers the
/// gate itself, on the same code path a deployed binary takes.
/// ⚑ AND IT IS AN INPUT TO THE ONE DISPOSITION, NOT A SECOND `return`. It used to be an
/// extra `#[cfg(test)] if test_override_active() { return; }` arm inside
/// [`guard_unaudited_fallback`], which meant the test binary's gate-absent DISPOSITION was
/// structurally a different function from the shipped one — the divergence class
/// `coord/src/atomic.rs::evaluate_votes_no_gate` was corrected for. It now flows through
/// [`unaudited_pq_accepted`], whose body is IDENTICAL under every cfg, so what the tests
/// exercise is the production predicate with one input flipped.
///
/// `DREGG_REQUIRE_LEAN=1` revokes it exactly as it revokes the operator opt-in — uniformly,
/// with no test-only exemption. So `DREGG_REQUIRE_LEAN=1 cargo test -p dregg-pq` aborts on
/// the first PQ operation, and that is the CORRECT answer: this unit-test binary cannot link
