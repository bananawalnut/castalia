//! **THE REFLECTIVE-INSPECTOR CARD** — the cockpit's inspector, reborn as a deos-js card.
//!
//! Today every cockpit surface (the inspector included) is hardcoded Rust gpui: its UI is
//! *compiled code*, so you cannot reshape it without a rebuild and the agent cannot rewrite
//! it. This module makes the inspector a **deos-js card** — a cell whose view is a
//! *view-tree* ([`crate::card_editor::ViewTree`], the same `{kind, props, children}` shape
//! [`deos-view`] renders) generated from a focused cell's **moldable reflective faces**:
//!
//!   - the **RawFields face** ([`deos_reflect::ReflectedCell::raw_fields`]) — the cell's
//!     four-substance state fields, rendered as labeled rows. A scalar state slot becomes a
//!     live [`ViewTree::Bind`] (the renderer re-reads it off the live ledger, so a turn that
//!     writes the slot updates the displayed row); the structural substances (balance,
//!     nonce, caps, lifecycle, …) render as labeled [`ViewTree::Text`].
//!   - the **Affordances face** ([`deos_reflect::AffordanceSurface::project_for`]) — the
//!     focused cell's cap-gated fireable affordances, each a [`ViewTree::Button`] whose click
//!     fires a REAL cap-gated verified turn (a `TurnReceipt`).
//!
//! Because the view is *data* (a view-tree = the card's `view_source` document), it is
//! **editable from within**: [`InspectorCard::edit_view`] patches the inspector card's OWN
//! view-source — relabel a face, add a field row, append a button — as a *receipted patch*
//! with *blame* (who authored each view line, in which patch). The inspector UI reshapes
//! live; the edit is an accountable patch, not a recompile. This is the Pharo-from-within
//! payoff: the real inspector, rewritten from inside, accountably.
//!
//! ## The live World
//!
//! The card's substance is a live verified World — a focused [`Applet`] cell on an embedded
//! [`dregg_sdk::embed::DreggEngine`] ledger. The faces are a pure function of that live
//! ledger ([`deos_reflect`]); a fired affordance is a real verified turn that advances the
//! cell on that same ledger. The inspector card and its focused cell are one sovereign cell
//! (the inspector reflects + reshapes itself — "the image is its own inspector"), so a fired
//! affordance updates a bound field row in place and the card's own view is the thing the
//! edit-from-within rewrites.
//!
//! ## The cap tooth is kept
//!
//! Both teeth are the proven [`dregg_cell::is_attenuation`] gate: a fired affordance is
//! checked against the card's `held` ([`Applet::fire`], in-band), and a view-edit is admitted
//! only when `held` satisfies the card's `edit_authority` ([`InspectorCard::authorized`]).
//! An unauthorized reshape is refused in-band — no patch, no receipt.
