//! # The emit-from-Lean EQUALITY GATE — `presentation` family (token-presentation summary AIR +
//! its off-AIR FRESHNESS binding).
//!
//! Validates the `emit-from-Lean` pattern for the `presentation` family
//! (`circuit/src/presentation.rs`). This descriptor carries the 19-column `row[i] == pi[i]`
//! summary copy AND internalizes the one off-AIR check that is a self-contained arithmetic
//! tooth: the FRESHNESS binding (`presentation::PresentationProof::verify_freshness_binding` —
//! accept iff `diff = not_after − verifier ∈ [0, p/2]`, `p/2 = 1_006_632_960`).
//!
//! ⚑ **The hand AIR this was transcribed from is GONE (2026-08-06), and it was a fiction.**
//! `impl Air for PresentationAir` declared exactly these 19 summary copies as
//! `|row, _, pi| row[i] - pi[i]` — but its own `generate_trace` returned
//! `public_inputs = row.clone()`, so every one of the nineteen evaluated `0 - 0` and NO witness,
//! honest or forged, could violate one. It also had zero callers of any kind (nothing in the
//! workspace ever handed a `PresentationAir` to `ConstraintValidator` or `TraceSummary`), so it
//! was dead weight rather than a live hole. It is deleted; THIS descriptor is the family's only
//! summary AIR, and its copies bite because its public inputs come from the caller instead of
//! from the trace. `forged_summary_pi_refuses` below is that difference, exhibited.
//!
//! The descriptor is AUTHORED in Lean
//! (`metatheory/Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/PresentationEmit.lean`, `presentationFreshnessDesc`) and its
//! wire string is byte-pinned there (`emitVmJson2` `#guard`). This test READS those EXACT bytes
//! ([`EMITTED_DESCRIPTOR_JSON`]) and:
//!
//!   1. DECODES it via [`parse_vm_descriptor2`] and asserts the decode equals an independently
//!      hand-built `EffectVmDescriptor2` (Lean emit ≡ Rust builder — a byte drift on either side
//!      breaks this OR the Lean `#guard`);
//!   2. proves an HONEST fresh-token witness through [`prove_vm_descriptor2`], asserts ACCEPT, and
//!      re-verifies against the public summary + `verifier_block_height`;
//!   3. the MUTATION CANARIES — each tampers ONE thing and asserts prove-or-verify REFUSES (real
//!      UNSAT), biting a DISTINCT constraint:
//!        - an EXPIRED token (`not_after < verifier`) → `diff` wraps to `p − …`, out of `[0, 2^30)`
//!          → the **diff Range** tooth (asserted with the range-specific error, so the refusal is
//!          provably the range mechanism);
//!        - an in-`[0,2^30)`-but-`> p/2` `diff` → the complement `hi = p/2 − diff` wraps → the
//!          **hi Range** tooth (the EXACT non-power-of-two `p/2` bound — the star tooth, the thing a
//!          single `Range{bits}` could NOT express);
//!        - an in-range but inconsistent `diff` → the **diff-binding gate**;
//!        - a forged summary PI → a **summary copy** (the literal deployed hand-AIR tooth);
//!        - a forged `verifier_block_height` PI → the **freshness public anchor**.
//!
//! Each canary is NON-VACUOUS: the honest witness proves-and-verifies (step 2 + in-canary sanity),
//! and each tamper genuinely breaks a named constraint.
//!
//! ## The NAMED gates (out of descriptor by design, per the `FITS_WITH_NAMED_GATE` verdict)
//!
//! `verify()`'s fold-chain continuity + derivation-root binding, issuer Merkle membership STARK,
//! temporal-predicate STARKs, and the presentation-tag hash ride the named recursion / STARK-leaf
//! argument (DECO-leaf posture) and are executor-verified — NOT internalized here. `not_after_height`
//! is a value published by the derivation leaf; this descriptor binds the freshness ARITHMETIC over
//! it and names the leaf that furnishes it.
