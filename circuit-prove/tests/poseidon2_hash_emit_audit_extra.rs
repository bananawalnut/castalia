//! ADDITIVE adversarial audit tamper for `poseidon2HashDesc` — the IN1 boundary pin (PI[1]).
//! The shipped gate (`poseidon2_hash_emit_gate.rs`) exercises the IN0 pin (4d, PI[0]) but NEVER the
//! IN1 pin. This isolates `in1Pin` (col 1 -> pi_index 1): honest trace, forged PI[1] -> UNSAT.
//! Plus a positive re-check that the honest witness accepts (non-vacuity guard).
