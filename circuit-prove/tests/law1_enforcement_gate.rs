//! **LAW #1 RATCHET** — the systematic enforcement of "zero Rust-authored constraints or AIRs, ever".
//!
//! `metatheory/README.md:15` states architectural law #1: *"Circuits are **emitted from Lean**... Rust only
//! INTERPRETS those artifacts. A coverage gap is closed by emitting from a new proved module, **never** by
//! hand-authoring a constraint."* Until this gate existed the law lived only in PROSE — and prose does not
//! fail a build.
//!
//! ## What this gate looks at (2026-07-25 rewrite — read this before trusting a number)
//!
//! The previous revision of this file was **blind in two directions at once**, and the two blindnesses
//! compounded: it scanned only `circuit/src` + `circuit-prove/src`, and within that scope it counted
//! `ConstraintExpr::` *textually*, which counts `match` PATTERNS as if they were authored algebra.
//!
//! * **Scope.** The single largest hand-written Rust AIR in the tree — `param-compose/src/air.rs` +
//!   `param-compose/src/builder.rs`, ~1000 lines, its own `Head` polynomial type, its own
//!   `assert_zero`, its own `air_accepts`, and a `tamper()` forgery harness — sat entirely OUTSIDE the
//!   scanned directories and was therefore invisible to a gate whose entire purpose is to see it. At
//!   the time of that rewrite it was live on a production path (`entity-compose/src/lib.rs` imported
//!   `dregg_param_compose::air::{ComposeAir, build}` in non-test code), both crates are workspace
//!   `default-members`, and `metatheory/` contained **no** `paramCompose` emitter. This gate now scans
//!   **every `.rs` file under any `src/` tree in the repository**, so a violation cannot hide by being
//!   in a different crate. **OUTCOME (2026-07-25): both files are DELETED.** Lean grew the route
//!   (`Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/ParamComposeEmit.lean` + `ParamComposeRefine`, all 18 corpus shapes
//!   `#guard`-pinned), the consumers and the whole test corpus moved onto the emitted descriptor, and
//!   the two `BASELINE` rows went with the files.
//! * **Counting.** `circuit/src/custom_leaf_lowering.rs` "violated" the old gate 46 times. Every one of
//!   those 46 is `ConstraintExpr::Variant { .. } =>` — a match arm in a LOWERING. Destructuring a
//!   constraint authors nothing. A gate that cries wolf 46 times gets ignored, and this one was: the
//!   previous revision, compiled and run against the tree it shipped with, **exited 101 — RED at HEAD**,
//!   its largest single "violation" being those 46 non-violations. Nobody noticed because the CI job
//!   that runs it (`cargo test --workspace`, `.github/workflows/ci.yml` Test (macos/ubuntu)) has been
//!   dying while compiling `dregg-lean-ffi`'s BUILD SCRIPT — ten `E0433`/`E0425`s against
//!   `build_parallel` — so the test binary is never linked and the gate never executes. A red gate
//!   nobody sees and a gate that does not run are the same object. So the gate now **classifies
//!   construction against destructuring** rather than grepping.
//!
//! ## The FIVE constraint dialects
//! A grep for one dialect sees a fifth of the truth. Miss one and you will miscount — that is the whole
//! point of this gate. In dependency order of how easy they are to overlook:
//!
//!   1. **plonky3 symbolic** — `x.assert_zero(..)` on ANY receiver. The previous revision hard-coded the
//!      receiver name `builder`, so `b.assert_zero(&Head::lin(..))` (param-compose's whole AIR, 19 sites)
//!      and `tb`/`lb`/`fb`/`self` receivers were unmatched. Receiver-agnostic now.
//!      `.assert_eq(..)` and `.when*(..)` join it ONLY in a file that mentions `AirBuilder` — `when` is a
//!      constraint dialect only in an AirBuilder context, and without that guard every gpui
//!      `.when(cond, ..)` in `starbridge-v2/src/cockpit/*` becomes a fake AIR violation.
//!   2. **closures** — `eval: Box::new(|row, _, pi| ..)`. Invisible to (1).
//!   3. **`ConstraintExpr` literals** — the DSL descriptor algebra. Invisible to (1) and (2).
//!   4. **descriptor gate trees** — `LeanExpr` / `VmConstraint` / `VmConstraint2` values built directly in
//!      Rust. This is the dialect that let a file truthfully say it "authors NO constraints" while
//!      authoring the entire descriptor. The worked example was `shielded_ring_clearing_air.rs`, which
//!      built 75 of them with no `include_str!` and no `parse_vm_descriptor2` anywhere in the file while
//!      its own module docblock said "NOT an AIR ... it authors NO constraints in any of the three
//!      dialects" — true of dialects (1)-(3) and false of the whole. That file is DELETED (2026-08-07,
//!      see its ledger note below); the dialect it exposed is why (4) exists. `perf/src/lib.rs`
//!      hand-builds a `VmConstraint2::MapOp` / `UMemOp` descriptor in a crate the old scope never reached.
//!   5. **`air_accepts` predicates** — a Rust-authored answer to "does the AIR accept this row". The law
//!      names these explicitly; they get their own ledger below (`AIR_ACCEPTS_LEDGER`) and their own test.
//!
//! ## AUTHORING vs LOWERING — the distinction, in code, not in an exclusion list
//! For dialects (3) and (4) the same text `ConstraintExpr::Binary { col }` is either **construction**
//! (algebra originates here — authoring) or **destructuring** (algebra arrived from somewhere else and is
//! being read — lowering / interpreting). `classify_site` decides it syntactically:
//!
//! * a `..` rest inside the braces is pattern-only (a struct-update base in an expression must be
//!   `..expr`, never bare `..`),
//! * a following `=>` (optionally through an `if` guard) or a following `|` is a match arm,
//! * `matches!(`, `if let`, `while let`, `let .. =` in binding position are patterns,
//! * anything else constructs.
//!
//! This is the *only* exclusion in the gate and it is a property of the source text, not a list of
//! forgiven filenames. It takes `custom_leaf_lowering.rs` from 46 phantom violations to 0 — while still
//! counting the 64 `LeanExpr` nodes that file really does construct, because a lowering that authors
//! `x·(x−1)` for `Binary` **is** authoring that algebra in Rust; that is exactly the debt
//! `CustomLeafEncoding.lean::cell_to_descriptor_faithful` exists to discharge. Destructuring is free;
//! construction is counted wherever it happens.
//!
//! ## `#[cfg(test)]` INSIDE a `src/` file is COUNTED — and that is not an accident (2026-07-30)
//! The scope test is `rel.contains("/src/")`, so the gate's "test code is not ratcheted" decision is
//! implemented as a **directory** property. That proxy is wrong in exactly one direction: a
//! `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` inside a `src/` file is test code that the directory test calls
//! production, and identical source text therefore scores 8 in `circuit-prove/src/foo.rs` and 0 in
//! `circuit-prove/tests/foo.rs`.
//!
//! **The strictness EARNED ITS KEEP, so it stays.** On 2026-07-30 the gate went red on
//! `circuit-prove/src/dregg_mina_config.rs` — 8 sites, 8 symbolic, all inside `#[cfg(test)]`, and all
//! of them a byte-identical THIRD copy of the toy Fibonacci AIR that `dregg_outer_config::tests` and
//! `gpu_backend::tests` already each carried. None of it was dregg constraint content; the file's own
//! module doc opened with "no AIR, no constraint, no gadget" and was, on the plumbing question,
//! correct. It was still a hand-written Rust AIR, and law #1's own words are that an existing Rust AIR
//! is debt rather than a foundation, so copying one **is** the drift. Had `#[cfg(test)]` been free,
//! that third copy would have landed silently and a fourth would have followed. The fix was
//! subtraction — three copies became one shared `dregg_outer_config::toy_fib_air` — and this gate was
//! not touched to make it green.
//!
//! What DID change is that `cfg_test_regions` now ATTRIBUTES sites, so a failure message can say
//! "ALL 8 inside `#[cfg(test)]`" instead of leaving the reader to open the file and guess whether the
//! gate mis-fired. Attribution only: `authored()` is unchanged, and `#[cfg(any(test, feature = ..))]`
//! deliberately does not count as test-only because that item ships whenever the feature is on.
//!
//! **The asymmetry's correct resolution is to close the `tests/` hole, not to widen the `src/`
//! exemption** — the direction of the law is fewer Rust-authored constraints, and the hole is the
//! looser side. That is a campaign, not a line: 847 sites across 41 files, most of them legitimate
//! emit-gate differentials that must be separated from the rest before any of it can be ratcheted.
//! **First rung, named so it is findable:** classify `tests/` sites into (a) differentials that build
//! a Rust expectation *and compare it against a Lean emission in the same file* — the law working —
//! and (b) everything else, then ratchet (b) alone. Until that exists, the bullet below stands.
//!
//! ## What this gate CANNOT see (say it out loud rather than imply coverage)
//! * **`tests/` trees.** 41 test files author 847 sites — overwhelmingly emit-gate differentials,
//!   which must build a Rust-side expectation in order to compare it against the Lean emission (that is
//!   the law working). They are not ratcheted here, so a hand-written AIR parked in a `tests/` directory
//!   is invisible to this gate. Scoped out deliberately, named as a hole. ⚑ And it is the LOOSER side
//!   of the `#[cfg(test)]` asymmetry above: moving a counted `src/` AIR into `tests/` would zero its
//!   score without deleting a line, which is laundering, not a fix.
//! * **Semantics.** The count is IR *nodes constructed*, not constraint *degree* or *soundness*. It is a
//!   monotone proxy: more Rust-authored algebra ⇒ a bigger number. It says nothing about whether a
//!   constraint is right, and a file can restructure to lower its number without emitting from Lean.
//! * **Indirection.** Algebra built through a helper that takes the variant as data (a `Vec<PolyTerm>`
//!   assembled far from any `ConstraintExpr::`) is undercounted; only the final constructor is seen.
//! * **Non-Rust hosts.** Solidity, Lean-adjacent scripts, and generated code under `target/` are out of
//!   scope, as are `docs/` snapshots of Rust (there is a byte-identical copy of `descriptor_ir2.rs` under
//!   `docs/deos/artifacts/` that is documentation, not a compiled unit).
//! * ⚑ **THE VENDORED FORKS — the largest blind spot, and it is Rust (named 2026-07-30).**
//!   `scan_repo` walks `repo_root()`, which is THIS repository. Every p3 crate enters as a **git
//!   dependency** on `emberian/plonky3-recursion` (pinned by rev in the root `Cargo.toml`), so
//!   `circuit-prover/src/air/{const,alu,public,recompose,expose_claim}_air.rs` — the ENTIRE primitive
//!   AIR layer the whole prover stands on — scores exactly **zero** here, no matter what is written in
//!   it. So do `vendor/plonky3-fri-82cfad73` and the other `[patch]`ed trees.
//!   MEASURED: `fc3c6df` added `builder.assert_eq(main.value[i], prep.value[i])` to `ConstAir::eval`,
//!   binding a constant's value into the preprocessed commitment. Run the gate's own classifier over
//!   that file and it scores **1 authored symbolic site**
//!   (`LAW1_EXPLAIN=../plonky3-recursion/circuit-prover/src/air/const_air.rs`); run the RATCHET and the
//!   delta is **0**, because the walker never reaches it. A zero delta from this gate is therefore NOT
//!   evidence that no Rust constraint was authored — only that none was authored *in this repo*.
//!   That change was a deliberate, recorded decision (it is a p3 primitive with no Lean authoring path
//!   short of replacing p3, and dregg's own circuit logic stayed Lean-authored), which is exactly why it
//!   is written down here rather than left to a silent zero.
//!   ⚑ The remedy is NOT to scan a sibling checkout: the fork resolves from git, so a fresh clone and CI
//!   have no sibling path to walk, and a gate that only fires on one developer's machine is worse than
//!   one that admits its scope. It needs a ratchet keyed to the **pinned rev** — a recorded per-rev site
//!   count for the fork's `src/` trees, checked against the resolved source in `~/.cargo/git/checkouts`.
//!   That is a campaign, not a line; until it exists, this bullet is the honest statement of coverage.
//! * **`metatheory/`** is skipped entirely — that is where the algebra is SUPPOSED to live.
//!
//! ## ⚑ RED AND UNOWNED FOR 25 HOURS — what a COUNT cannot tell you (2026-07-31)
//!
//! This gate went red at `81ee5492d` (2026-07-30 20:04:39) and was still red a day later. Two
//! commits that edit THIS FILE landed inside that window — `300591cfc` (21:30, the Mina toy-AIR
//! de-duplication) and `fd507d99b` (23:14) — and neither noticed, because neither ran it. Two
//! other lanes DID hit the red, each investigated it, and each correctly concluded "not mine"
//! and moved on. Meanwhile every brief written that day asserted the gate was green.
//!
//! **The count was RIGHT in all three rows.** What failed was the DIAGNOSTIC. A row that says
//! `283 -> 287` names a file and a delta, and there was no supported way to ask WHICH four sites
//! moved: reconstructing it took a standalone re-compile of this file's classifier plus a
//! 40-revision walk of each file's history. A lane that owns an unrelated change will always,
//! and correctly, decide that is not its job. **A red that cannot be attributed is a red that
//! will not be owned** — so the repair belongs in the MESSAGE, not in the ledger:
//!
//! * a `GREW` row now prints the grown file's authored sites: a by-kind histogram (a growth of
//!   four is usually a SINGLETON variant, findable at a glance) and, at or under 40 sites, every
//!   line, with `#[cfg(test)]` membership marked;
//! * `LAW1_EXPLAIN` now lists the SYMBOLIC and CLOSURE dialects too. It listed only dialects
//!   (3)+(4), so a maintainer auditing `descriptor_ir2.rs`'s 287 saw 169 lines and could not
//!   reconcile the listing with the number — the 118 `assert_zero`-family sites were invisible;
//! * the failure message carries the recipe that finds the origin COMMIT without a bisect.
//!   `LAW1_EXPLAIN` resolves through `Path::join`, so an ABSOLUTE path wins and
//!   `git show <rev>:<file> > /tmp/at-rev.rs` feeds it directly.
//!
//! ⚑ **THE STRICTNESS DID NOT MOVE.** No exemption was added, no dialect dropped, no classifier
//! loosened; `authored()` is byte-for-byte the same predicate. The three rows were re-pinned to
//! their MEASURED values with the origin commit and the nature of every site written into the
//! row — see the three `RE-PINNED 2026-07-31` blocks in `BASELINE`, which is where a reader six
//! weeks out has to be able to find them.
//!
//! ## The TRANSPORT class — a real over-count, NAMED rather than silently forgiven
//!
//! Five of those eleven sites are one shape, and it is worth a name because it will recur:
//!
//! ```text
//! WindowExpr::Add(a, b) => LeanExpr::Add(Box::new(f(a)?), Box::new(f(b)?))
//! ```
//!
//! Every argument was DESTRUCTURED from the same algebra one line earlier; the operator, the
//! arity and the columns are all fixed by the node being read. Nothing ORIGINATES — which is
//! precisely this gate's own authoring-vs-lowering test — yet `classify_site` scores it
//! `Construct`, because it looks only at the syntactic position of the CONSTRUCTED node and the
//! source type (`WindowExpr`) is not in `IR_TYPES`. So the arm counts +1 authored and +0
//! lowering. This is a genuine over-count and it is not the same thing as
//! `custom_leaf_lowering.rs`, which maps `Binary` to `x·(x−1)` and therefore really does choose
//! algebra in Rust.
//!
//! **It is named here and NOT auto-detected, deliberately.** Every syntactic rule tried against
//! the real specimens either under-fires (variant-name equality frees `Add`/`Mul`/`Const` but
//! not `Loc -> Var`, leaving the row red at 284 and the rule looking principled while doing
//! nothing) or needs an argument-provenance analysis — "every argument is a binding of this
//! arm's pattern or a recursive call" — which is a real mini-parser inside the one gate whose
//! wrongness is most expensive. A classifier that stops over-matching by also under-matching is
//! worse than the false positive it fixes, and a buggy classifier in the LAW gate is worse than
//! a number that is right for a boring reason. If a third transport shows up, THAT is the
//! moment to build the provenance analysis — with these five as its fixtures.
//!
//! ## Two MORE over-counts, named on the same terms (2026-08-06)
//!
//! The 179 -> 198 repair on `descriptor_ir2.rs` turned up two shapes this gate had never scored
//! before. Both are named here and NEITHER is auto-detected, for the reason above.
//!
//!   * ⚑ **THE CONSTANT-FALSE REFUSAL.** `builder.assert_zero(AB::Expr::ONE)` asserts `1 = 0`: it
//!     names no column and no coefficient, and it makes the AIR unsatisfiable on a shape an
//!     admission door already refused. It is `return Err` spelled in the AIR — the OPPOSITE of
//!     authoring a constraint — and dialect (1) scores it 1 because dialect (1) counts syntactic
//!     `assert_zero` call sites and looks at nothing else. There are five at HEAD.
//!     ⚠ **Do not exempt it.** A syntactic "argument is a bare constant path" rule is easy to
//!     write and impossible to smuggle algebra through, and it is STILL the wrong trade: an
//!     exemption list in the LAW gate costs more than five over-counted sites, and the pressure a
//!     count creates on a fail-closed backstop — *delete the refusal and the gate goes green* —
//!     is a pressure this repo can least afford to point that way. The row carries the reason
//!     instead, which is what a reader needs.
//!   * ⚑ **THE VECTOR-VALUED INTERPRETER ARM.** `Ir2Air`'s row-local walk ends in ONE shared
//!     `builder.assert_zero(match sel { .. })`, so `Gate`/`Boundary`/`Transition`/`PiBinding`/
//!     `WindowGate` — five node kinds, every descriptor, thousands of constraints — cost this file
//!     exactly ONE site between them. A node kind whose Lean denotation is a VECTOR of congruences
//!     (`ProofBind.holdsAt` is `1 + n + n` of them) cannot fold into that tail and pays per call
//!     site. So the number moves with a node kind's ARITY, not with how much algebra originates in
//!     Rust — and `PiBinding`, whose polynomial `local[col] − pv[pi]` is just as Rust-chosen, has
//!     always been free. This is the sharpest known limit of dialect (1) as a proxy; a real fix is
//!     the same provenance analysis the TRANSPORT class needs, on the same terms.
//!
//! ## If this test fails
//! You (or an agent) hand-authored a constraint in Rust. That is the violation itself — do NOT add your
//! file to the baseline to make it green. Emit it from Lean instead (`metatheory/Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/*.lean`
//! -> `emitVmJson2` -> `descriptors/by-name/*.json` -> `descriptor_by_name` -> `prove_vm_descriptor2`; see
//! `EffectVmEmitTurnChainBinding.lean` + `metatheory/EmitTurnChain.lean` for the worked end-to-end example).
//! Lower the baseline when you retire algebra. RAISING a row needs a reason written INTO THE ROW —
//! the origin commit, and what each new site is if it is not AIR. In the row, not in a companion
//! document: the 2026-07-31 red was investigated three times because the reasons for the numbers
//! were nowhere near the numbers, and a reason a reader has to go find is a reason nobody reads.
//! A silent re-print to green is the move CLAUDE.md was written against; it turns a law into a habit.
//! `LAW1_PRINT_BASELINE=1 cargo test -p dregg-circuit-prove --test law1_enforcement_gate -- --nocapture`
//! prints the current ledger in source form, so a legitimate SHRINK is a copy-paste.
//!
//! ## Why entries remain (the honest ledger, not an amnesty)
//! * INTERPRETERS (the law WORKING — they evaluate Lean-authored constraints): `descriptor_ir2.rs`,
//!   `descriptor_ir2_canonical.rs`, `dsl/dsl_p3_air.rs`, `lean_lookup_air.rs` (the proven range gadget).
//!   Their *pattern* halves are now free; the residual is the IR they construct while translating.
//! * PROVED-FAITHFUL LOWERINGS: `custom_leaf_adapter.rs` / `custom_leaf_lowering.rs` —
//!   `CustomLeafEncoding.lean::cell_to_descriptor_faithful` proves the encoding preserves semantics.
//! * DRIFT-DETECTORS, deliberately kept: `dsl/derivation.rs`, `dsl/note_spending.rs` — the EMITTED paths
//!   walk these v1 descriptors as their SOURCE, so "a drift in the deployed circuit is a build-time
//!   refusal, never a silent divergence" (`note_spend_witness.rs:225-227`).
//! * THE USER-PROGRAM GRAMMAR: `dsl/predicates/*`, `dsl/descriptors.rs` — the host-trusted smart-contract
//!   surface users deploy programs against; interpreted, fails closed on an unknown vk_hash.
//! * THE ONE TEST-ONLY TOY AIR: `dregg_outer_config.rs` (8) — `toy_fib_air::ToyFibAir`, the p3
//!   uni-stark 2-column Fibonacci, `#[cfg(test)]`-gated and shared by all three configs in the crate
//!   (CPU outer, GPU outer, Mina terminal). A `StarkConfig` round-trip needs *an* AIR to prove and it
//!   must deliberately not be a dregg one. Was THREE copies until 2026-07-30; `gpu_backend.rs` (8) and
//!   a fresh `dregg_mina_config.rs` (8) are both retired into this row.
//! * NAMED RESIDUALS — real debt, now VISIBLE for the first time:
//!   - ~~**`param-compose/src/{air,builder}.rs` (28) + the `entity-compose` consumer.**~~ **CLOSED
//!     2026-07-25 — DELETED, 1028 lines.** It was a complete hand-written Rust AIR: 24 `assert_zero`
//!     sites, its own `ConstraintExpr` emission, `air_accepts`, and `tamper()`, and `builder.rs`
//!     documented itself as "a sibling of `dregg-automatafl`'s builder … duplicated rather than
//!     shared" — the automatafl Rust-AIR deletion was recorded as complete, but the clone had already
//!     been copied out into `param-compose/`, where it survived precisely because it was outside this
//!     gate's old scope. The "There is NO Lean route" line this entry carried is what changed:
//!     `Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/ParamComposeEmit.lean` now authors the whole AIR and byte-pins the wire,
//!     `ParamComposeRefine.paramCompose_refines_law` refines it, and all 18 shapes the test corpus
//!     exercises are `#guard`-pinned, so consumers and tests alike ride the emitted descriptor.
//!     Deleting it was the fix; this line is the receipt that it happened. (The honest price — four
//!     coverage items that lost their only checker — is recorded in `param-compose/src/lib.rs`.)
//!   - **`perf/src/lib.rs` (28)** — a hand-built `VmConstraint2::{MapOp,UMemOp}` descriptor, dialect (4),
//!     in a crate no previous audit scanned.
//!   - `ivc.rs` + `dsl/fold.rs` (`FoldAir`) — test-only; `ivc`'s emitter is one Lean PROVES insufficient
//!     (`ivc_anchor_insufficient`).
//!   - `dregg-dsl-differential/*`, `dregg-dsl-runtime/src/composition.rs`, `constraint-lowering/src/lib.rs`,
//!     `game-turn-slice/src/compiler.rs`, `sdk/src/full_turn_proof.rs`, `turn/src/umem.rs`,
//!     `tests/src/dsl_pipeline.rs` — the rest of the surface the two-directory scope hid.

/// **untracked, `.gitignore`d, separately-`git init`ed** checkout of HEAD that a lane creates to

/// it were source. MEASURED 2026-08-07: **2 890 `.rs` files under a `src/` inside `headver/`**, two
/// of which define `air_accepts`. Every ledgered file was re-reported a second time under the
/// `headver/` prefix, where no `BASELINE` row matches it, which is the gate's definition of a NEW
/// violation — and the two `air_accepts` copies were unledgered by the same mechanism. **Two
/// failing cases, both pure artefact**, and the ledger they printed was the ledger DUPLICATED.
///
/// That is a gate aimed at a directory that is not in the repository. A deny-list cannot fix it —
/// the next scratch checkout has a different name. So scope is now an ALLOW-list taken from
/// `git ls-files`: a file is in scope iff git tracks it. `SKIP_DIRS` stays because it is also the

/// and because the synthetic-tree red path has no git to ask.
///

/// silently reverting to the untracked walk — a scope oracle that fails open is how the gate got
/// here.
///

    // LOWERED 236 -> 204 on 2026-08-02 (seventh pass): the `Ir2Air::MapOps` arm — the map

    // ⓘ SEVEN helpers went with it, and TWO of them were ALREADY DEAD AT HEAD: `eval_canon_decomp`
    // and `eval_lex_lt` (the UNCOUNTED canonical-split and comparator emitters) lost their last
    // caller in the `Ir2Air::MapAbsent` cutover on 2026-08-01 and were left standing — 20 of the 32
    // sites this pass retires are theirs and the three GATE-COUNTED twins'. The rest are
    // `map_group8`, `node8_lookup_tuple`, `map_log_tuple`, `map_leaf_input_cols` and `KEY_HI_BASE`.
    // A ratchet counts what is THERE, not what runs, so dead Rust-authored algebra scores exactly
    // like live Rust-authored algebra — which is the correct behaviour and is why they are deleted

    // ⚑ RE-PINNED 2026-08-02, 204 -> 180: the `Ir2Air::Chip | Ir2Air::ChipState16` arm — the

    // VARIANTS are gone from the enum, so `Ir2Air` is now Main / LeanTable / ExactPublicTable —
    // three arms, one of which is the interpreter and one of which is the last hand-written one.
    // ⓘ `BUS_FACT` and `WindowExpr::degree` went with it (their only readers were in that arm), and
    // `max_constraint_degree` lost its hardcoded `Some(7)`: the chip's degree now comes out of the
    // emitted definition list through `LeanTableAir::def_degrees`, and `ir2_degree_budget` is
    // UNCHANGED because sharing is a change of representation, not of degree.
    // ⚑ RE-PINNED 2026-08-02, 180 -> 179: the `Ir2Air::ExactPublicTable` arm — the ELEVENTH AND
    // LAST hand-written table AIR in this file, and the smallest (one `assert_zero` pinning a
    // committed capacity column to a preprocessed one, plus one `table_entry` leg) — was DELETED
    // and replaced by an `Ir2Air::LeanTable` walking a Lean-emitted FAMILY
    // (`Emit/ExactPublicTableEmit.lean` -> `dregg-ir2-exact-public-v1.json`, 64 members, one per
    // declared tuple arity). The VARIANT is gone from the enum.
    // ⚑ **SO `Ir2Air` IS NOW `Main | LeanTable`, and that is the point of the number rather than
    // the number itself.** One arm interprets the MAIN descriptor and one interprets a
    // Lean-authored TABLE; there is no arm of that enum where a constraint can be written, so law
    // #1's failure mode — "the Rust AIR crate is right there, every step compiles" — has no entry
    // point on the IR-v2 path at all, and a new shared table is an EMISSION rather than a variant.
    // ⓘ The delta is ONE because the arm was one `assert_zero`; the eleven ports together moved
    // this row 287 -> 179. What the last one cost was in the IR, not in the constraint: a `prep`
    // expression leaf reading a SECOND (verifier-recomputed) column space, its own declared
    // `prep_width` bound, and a schema rather than a table — `TableAirIR` §7, all four items.
    // ⓘ `exact_public_bus_name` did NOT go dead and did not shrink this row: it keys on the ARITY
    // now (`ir2_exact_public_a{n}`) with the table id moved into the served tuple, because an
    // artifact cannot know a table id — which is what made a per-arity Lean-emitted family
    // possible. `Ir2Air::Main`'s QUERY side still calls it, so the name is a genuine coupling
    // between this file and the Lean author, exactly like `ir2_p2` / `ir2_p2_narrow`.

    //
    // The nineteen are FOUR objects, and only ONE of them is polynomial algebra:
    //
    //  * **10 `#[cfg(test)]` sites**, in two tests. `f2fc52c39` (+6) added
    //    `ir2_three_range_widths_coexist_and_prove` — a SYNTHETIC three-table descriptor
    //    (3 `VmConstraint2::Lookup` + 3 `LeanExpr::Var`) built to show a 29/16/8-bit range trio
    //    coexists; nothing emits it and nothing should. `72e86fc8d` (+4) added
    //    `parses_lean_proof_bind_golden` — 4 `LeanExpr::{Var,Const}` built as the EXPECTED half of
    //    `assert_eq!` against a `proof_bind` DECODED FROM the Lean golden, i.e. a differential,
    //    which is the law working. Counted because `#[cfg(test)]`-inside-`src/` is counted on
    //    purpose (module docs); the row moves, the rule does not.
    //  * **5 `assert_zero(AB::Expr::ONE)` — a constant-FALSE REFUSAL, not a constraint.** Three in
    //    the `ProofBind` arm (`commit.len() != vk.len()`, and either declared pin shorter than the
    //    vector it pins — `72e86fc8d`), two for the challenge leaf (`dc5abe4ab`: the short
    //    `permutation_randomness()` backstop in `Ir2Air::Main`, and `Ir2UniAir`'s unreachable
    //    `ChalGate` arm). `1 = 0` names no column and no coefficient; it is `return Err` spelled in
    //    the AIR, under an admission door that already refused the same shape. ⚑ NOT auto-detected,
    //    for the reason the TRANSPORT class is not: a syntactic exemption in the LAW gate is worth
    //    less than a number that is right for a boring reason — and the incentive it would create,
    //    "delete the backstop to make the gate green", is the one this repo can least afford.
    //  * **1 `VmConstraint2::ChalGate(..)` in `parse_constraint2`** — the JSON DECODER's `chal_gate`
    //    arm (`dc5abe4ab`). Pure TRANSPORT: the node is being rebuilt from bytes Lean emitted. Its
    //    three siblings in the same `match` (`WindowGate`, `ProofBind`, the `v1tag` `Base`) are
    //    already inside the 179, so this is growth of an ALREADY-COUNTED class, not a new one.
    //  * **3 genuine congruence bodies** — the `VmConstraint2::ProofBind` arm of
    //    `eval_row_local_constraints` (`46493491d`): `guard·(guard − 1)`, `guard·(vk − vk_pin)`,
    //    `guard·(commit − bound)`. This is the ONE that is polynomial algebra, and it is the
    //    interpreter of an IR NODE whose meaning is `DescriptorIR2.ProofBind.holdsAt` in Lean —
    //    the same act as rendering `VmConstraint::PiBinding{row,col,pi}` as `local[col] − pv[pi]`,
    //    which has ridden the shared `assert_zero` tail inside this row since the beginning.
    //    ⚑ It scores 3 rather than 0 only because the arm emits a VECTOR of bodies and therefore
    //    cannot use that shared tail: dialect (1) counts syntactic call SITES and has no
    //    authoring-vs-lowering classifier at all, so a node kind whose denotation is `1 + n + n`
    //    congruences scores per-site while one whose denotation is a bus send scores zero.
    //    ⚠ And what it BOUGHT is why it is not being undone: before `3f4d703ae` this kind denoted
    //    NOTHING in either language — `.proofBind` sat in the `continue` list and emitted no bus
    //    interaction either — so a row's claim about its sub-proof was unconstrained. Deleting
