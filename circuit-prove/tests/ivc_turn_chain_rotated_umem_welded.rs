//! WHOLE-CHAIN IVC FOLD over the WELDED ROTATED+UMEM leg (STAGED, VK-RISK-FREE) — the IVC half of
//! the flag-day weld, the last precursor before the gated VK epoch.
//!
//! The sibling `ivc_turn_chain_rotated.rs` folds a multi-turn history through the DEPLOYED rotated
//! leg. THIS file proves the same fold runs through the WELDED rotated+umem leg
//! (`mint_welded_umem_rotated_participant_leg` → `RotatedParticipantLeg::mint_welded_from_block_witnesses`):
//! each finalized turn carries ONE leaf that proves BOTH the rotated cohort semantics AND the
//! universal-memory reconciliation (the cohort `umemOp` over 7 appended columns + the real
//! `UMemBoundaryWitness`), and the chain fold reads the SAME rotated `old_root`/`new_root` (PI
//! 34/35 — intact through the weld) it always did. That intactness is exactly what resolves the
//! 0-PI cohort leg's IVC incompatibility (the cohort form carried no PIs for the fold to chain).
//!
//! - `welded_umem_chain_folds_host` — a continuous 3-turn welded history folds (continuity tooth +
//!   ordered-history digest) through `fold_welded_umem_turn_chain_staged`. CI-runnable (no
//!   recursion aggregation; the welded legs mint under the leaf-wrap config).
//! - `welded_umem_broken_order_rejected` — a spliced out-of-order welded turn is refused at the
//!   continuity tooth (`ChainBreak`). CI-runnable.
//! - `welded_umem_chain_folds_recursive` — the full in-circuit recursion fold over the welded
//!   leaves (`prove_welded_umem_turn_chain_recursive_staged`), `#[ignore]` (minutes).
