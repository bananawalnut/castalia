//! ADVERSARIAL AUDIT — one additional isolating tamper the shipped gate did NOT write.
//!
//! The shipped `accumulator_nonrev_emit_gate.rs` isolates the *alpha_aux* constancy window gate
//! (`tampered_alpha_aux_drift_refuses`) but never isolates the TWIN *acc_aux* constancy window
//! gate. Without the acc_aux constancy, a prover could drift `acc_aux` on a non-first row and
//! (since `sum==acc_aux` is only a per-row equality, and `sum==pi[ACC]` is pinned on the FIRST row
//! only) claim a DIFFERENT accumulator on later rows — the exact hand-AIR gap the emit closes.
//!
//! This test builds a fully self-consistent middle row whose ONLY deviation is a drifted
//! `acc_aux = Acc + 1` (so `sum==acc_aux`, C1..C4, `check==1` all hold on that row, and the row-0
//! acc_aux pin is untouched). The SOLE constraint that can bite is the `acc_aux` constancy
//! `.windowGate`. Non-vacuity control: the same construction with the TRUE Acc (no drift) is
//! ACCEPTED. Drives the REAL `prove_vm_descriptor2` / `verify_vm_descriptor2`.
