/// identity block in exactly one of two ways, and they are not interchangeable:
///
///  * **BAKE it** as circuit constants, the way `apexPreprocessedCommit` is baked. Legitimate
///    only if the value is the SAME for every chain the deployed settlement circuit is meant to
///    accept — otherwise baking silently narrows the verifier to one chain length.
///  * **PUBLISH it** as further Groth16 public inputs, which keeps the verifier length-generic
///    and moves the on-chain arity 25 → 33 (three chains' verifiers re-emit).
///
/// **DECIDED 2026-08-08: length-genericity is NOT taken, and publishing the spine would not buy
/// it.** The measurement below is why. Folding real chains of 2, 3, 4 and 5 turns at HEAD moves
/// ALL THREE of the `RecursionVk` fingerprint, the `apex_preprocessed_commit` lanes and the root
/// VK spine at every length — so the thing that varies is not just the spine block, it is the
/// APEX CIRCUIT ITSELF. Publishing the spine as public input would leave
/// `apexPreprocessedCommit` — a baked constant this circuit `connect`s to the apex verification's
/// preprocessed-commitment inputs — still specific to one length. There is no binding choice at
/// this layer that reaches length-genericity.
///
/// Getting it is **root-shape normalization in the recursion tower** (the fork's
/// `normalize_to_shape_spike`), i.e. a DESIGN CHANGE to how the tower folds, not a repair of a
/// pin, an artifact or a binding. It is not taken here and this file does not pretend otherwise.
///
/// ## So the constraint is STATED — [`DREGG_APEX_PINNED_CHAIN_TURNS`] — and ENFORCED HERE
///
/// It was already enforced, by accident and by nobody's decision: a chain of any other length
/// derives a different fingerprint, so `check_apex_vk_identity_pin` fails closed against the
/// governance anchor and the pinned shrink cannot even witness. Enforcement that nothing asserts
/// is enforcement nobody can rely on and nobody can notice losing, so this test now asserts it in
/// BOTH polarities:
///
///  * **ACCEPT** — the identity derived at [`DREGG_APEX_PINNED_CHAIN_TURNS`] passes the
///    governance pin. Without this the refusals below would be vacuous (a pin that refuses
///    everything refuses nothing in particular).
///  * **REFUSE** — the identity derived at every other length in 3..=5 FAILS the same pin. That
///    is the settlement path declining to settle a chain it is not the verifier of.
///
/// It stays armed for the converse too: if root-shape normalization ever lands, the identities
/// stop varying, this goes green-to-RED, and the binding must be re-decided rather than
/// inherited.
///
/// ⚠ HONEST LABEL: four concrete lengths — a Rust case-test with no formal content. It does not
/// prove the identity varies for every pair of lengths, and it is not a proof that no other
/// length can settle; it is the *observation* that decides the design question, plus the
/// *assertion* that the governance anchor is what stands between the deployed circuit and a
