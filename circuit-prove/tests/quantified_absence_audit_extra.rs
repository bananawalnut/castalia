//! ADVERSARIAL AUDIT ADDENDUM (additive, new file) for the `quantified_absence` emit.
//!
//! The implementer's six canaries each tamper a value that feeds a LIMB-0 gate (elem→C1₀,
//! w→C2₀…, v→C3₀) or a whole-vector forge. The Lean `_zero_iff` lemmas only prove LIMB 0 of
//! each gate. The residual vacuity risk this addendum closes: are the HIGHER-limb gates
//! (C2 limb 2, and a limb-3 boundary pin) actually structurally correct and enforced, or could
//! a forgery that keeps limb 0 consistent slip through a bogus higher-limb gate?
//!
//! Two NEW isolating tampers, each proven to be REJECTED BY ONE SPECIFIC higher-limb constraint:
//!   (A) forge PRODUCT limb 2 only, and repair C3₂ + boundary₂ so ONLY the C2 limb-2 ext-mult
//!       gate can fire — a clean single-constraint bite on a NON-limb-0 gate.
//!   (B) forge Acc_all PI at limb 3 only → the limb-3 boundary pin bites (not limb 0).
