//! ADVERSARIAL AUDIT — one additional isolating tamper the dfa_routing_emit_gate did NOT do:
//! forge the `initial_state` public input (PI_INITIAL). The honest proof re-verified against a
//! forged initial-state PI must be refused by the B1 first-row `PiBinding` (col CURRENT ← pi[0]).
//! This is disjoint from the five existing canaries (final/route/seed/forbidden-edge/running-hash).

/// `r#"…"#` transcription of the Lean `#guard` bytes, and the `challenges` flag day
/// (2026-08-05) broke it along with 27 siblings: the artifact under
/// `circuit/descriptors/` was re-emitted, the literal was not, and
/// `parse_vm_descriptor2` refused it with `ir:2 descriptor missing "challenges"`. An
/// inline golden is a copy that no re-emit reaches, so every flag day breaks exactly
/// that set again — the fix is to have no copy. `check-emit-gate-weld.py` still gates
/// the literals that remain (the descriptors with no checked-in artifact to name), and
/// `check-descriptor-drift.sh` gates this file against its Lean author.
