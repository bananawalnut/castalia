//! # The emit-from-Lean EQUALITY GATE — 4-ary Poseidon2 Merkle membership (depth 2).
//!
//! Validates the `emit-from-Lean` pattern end-to-end on ONE family, and with it the
//! `Poseidon2Chip` arity-4 lookup mapping that ~15 hash-carrying families depend on.
//!
//! The descriptor is AUTHORED in Lean (`metatheory/Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/MerkleMembershipEmit.lean`,
//! `merkleMembershipDesc`) and its wire string is byte-pinned there (`emitVmJson2` `#guard`). This
//! test READS those EXACT bytes ([`EMITTED_DESCRIPTOR_JSON`]), and:
//!
//!   1. DECODES it via [`parse_vm_descriptor2`] and asserts the decode equals an independently
//!      hand-built `EffectVmDescriptor2` (Lean emit ≡ Rust builder — a byte drift on either side
//!      breaks this OR the Lean `#guard`);
//!   2. KATs the arity-4 chip mapping: `chip_absorb_all_lanes(4, [a,b,c,d])[0] == hash_4_to_1`
//!      (the family-wide lemma — a `TID_P2` lookup with arity tag 4 IS `hash_4_to_1`);
//!   3. proves an HONEST membership witness (real leaf + siblings + genuine `hash_4_to_1` chain up
//!      to a root) through [`prove_vm_descriptor2`], asserts ACCEPT, and re-verifies the proof;
//!   4. the MUTATION CANARY — tampers the claimed root / the leaf / a sibling / a parent digest and
//!      asserts the prove-or-verify REFUSES (real UNSAT). This is the equality gate: the emitted
//!      descriptor accepts EXACTLY the honest membership statement the hand AIR
//!      (`circuit/src/poseidon2_air.rs::MerklePoseidon2StarkAir`) did.
//!
//! The mutation canaries are NON-VACUOUS by construction: each asserts the honest witness proves
//! (step 3) AND that the tampered witness names a genuinely different statement (its recomputed
//! root differs from the claimed root) before asserting refusal.
