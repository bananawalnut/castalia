//! The UNBOUNDED ONLINE ACCUMULATOR — the running left-fold over finalized turns.
//!
//! ## What this is (and how it differs from the K-fold tree)
//!
//! [`ivc_turn_chain::prove_turn_chain_recursive`](crate::ivc_turn_chain::prove_turn_chain_recursive)
//! folds a *finite* window of K finalized turns into one root proof via a BALANCED BINARY TREE
//! (`aggregate_tree`): it needs ALL K turns in memory at once, and the tree shape (hence the root
//! VK fingerprint) depends on K.
//!
//! This module is the SEQUENTIAL DUAL: a running accumulator that holds ONE `RecursionOutput` (the
//! O(1)-memory running proof) and EXTENDS it ONE finalized turn at a time:
//!
//! ```text
//!   acc_0 = genesis (the empty fold)
//!   acc_n = accumulate(acc_{n-1}, turn_n)
//! ```
//!
//! `accumulate(acc, turn)` is the genuine IVC step:
//!   1. verify `turn`'s leaf (host admission + the in-circuit descriptor leaf re-proof);
//!   2. **verify `acc_{n-1}`'s running proof IN-CIRCUIT** — the recursion: the previous running
//!      `RecursionOutput.0` (a `BatchStarkProof`) rides back in as a [`BatchOnly`] recursion input
//!      (`acc.running.into_recursion_input::<BatchOnly>()`), so the next aggregation layer's
//!      in-circuit FRI verifier RE-VERIFIES it. This is the same `into_recursion_input::<BatchOnly>`
//!      re-verification [`aggregate_tree`](crate::ivc_turn_chain) already performs at every internal
//!      tree node — driven here as a running LEFT-fold rather than a balanced tree;
//!   3. bind `acc_{n-1}.head_root == turn_n.pre_root`, advance `head_root = turn_n.post_root`,
//!      `num_turns += 1`, `chain_digest = H(prev_digest, old, new, idx)`;
//!   4. aggregate `running ∘ new_turn_leaf` into the NEW running `RecursionOutput`.
//!
//! **O(1) PROOF memory, O(num_turns) scalar binding state (precise).** The dominant cost — the
//! running RECURSION PROOF — is O(1): one [`RecursionOutput`] is held regardless of chain length, and
//! the consumed turns (proofs) are dropped. The accumulator ALSO retains a small per-turn scalar
//! witness — the four chain commitments (O(1)) PLUS `seam_pairs`, the ordered `(old_root, new_root)`
//! pairs (two field elements per folded turn), which `finalize` replays to rebuild the chain-binding
//! leaf so its digest reproduces the running `chain_digest`. So the running STATE is O(num_turns)
//! SCALARS, not O(1) — though the proof memory (the expensive part) is genuinely constant. Folding
//! the binding incrementally so `seam_pairs` vanishes is named open work (prereq (b) below).
//!
//! ## SEGMENT-ACCUMULATOR — PORTED (the mixed-root analog, CLOSED for the online path)
//!
//! The K-fold tree (`ivc_turn_chain`) closed the mixed-root hole by carrying an ordered
//! SEGMENT on every DESCRIPTOR leaf and combining segments in-circuit (so the whole-chain
//! claim is derived from the real executions, with no swappable binding leaf). This online
//! accumulator now carries the SAME genuine 4-lane W24 Poseidon2 segment digest, ported
//! exactly from the K-fold close:
//!   - **leaf** ([`prove_descriptor_leaf_rotated_with_segment`]): each `accumulate` step's
//!     descriptor leaf carries `[first_old, last_new, count=1, acc=commit([old,new])]`,
//!     bound in-circuit to the descriptor proof's REAL rotated roots.
//!   - **running combine** ([`combine_segments_expose`]): the running fold re-exposes the
//!     parent segment with `acc = commit(L.acc ++ R.acc)` where L = the running segment and
//!     R = the new leaf's segment — the LEFT-LINEAR analog of the K-fold balanced combine,
//!     with identical continuity / count / ordered-digest constraints. So the running proof
//!     carries the whole-chain segment by construction.
//!   - **finalize** ([`Accumulator::finalize`]): the running proof IS the root; its exposed
//!     segment `[genesis_root, head_root, num_turns, chain_digest]` is the whole-chain claim
//!     derived from the REAL descriptor leaves. `verify_turn_chain_recursive`'s SEGMENT tooth
//!     checks the carried claim against it, fail-closed. The `TurnChainBindingAir` leaf is
//!     STILL produced for the carried `binding_proof` field (byte-API / defense-in-depth) but
//!     is NO LONGER a soundness dependency and is NOT folded into the root — exactly as the
//!     K-fold path now carries (not folds) its binding proof.
//!
//! So a same-endpoint mixed-root forgery against the online whole-chain proof is REJECTED by
//! the same construction the K-fold uses (witness: `online_mixed_root_forgery_rejected`).
//!
//! ## What is GENUINELY here vs the named in-band gap (honest, tiered)
//!
//! **BUILT + RUNNING:** the running-fold DRIVER over the REAL recursion primitives. Each step does a
//! real in-circuit re-verification of the running batch proof (step 2) and a real in-circuit
//! descriptor-leaf re-proof (step 1), aggregated to a new running root. The temporal binding
//! (`prev.head_root == next.old_root`) is enforced host-side (the [`AccError::ChainBreak`] tooth) and
//! the running summary advances correctly. The terminal [`Accumulator::finalize`] reuses the proven
//! `verify_turn_chain_recursive` verify discipline, so a light client's
//! [`lightclient::verify_history`] accepts the accumulated artifact under its honest VK anchor.
//!
//! **THE TWO FORK LEVERS — NOW LANDED IN-BAND (lever a + b), with the precise residual NAMED.**
//! The recursion fork (`emberian/plonky3-recursion`) now exposes the two mechanisms this fold needs:
//!   - **(a) VK identity of the re-folded running proof — PINNED in-band.** The parent aggregation
//!     circuit takes the child's preprocessed commitment (its verifier-key core) as public-input
//!     targets, but their VALUE was unconstrained. The fork's `into_recursion_input_pinned()` /
//!     `pin_preprocessed_commit()` now `connect` those targets to an expected commitment IN-CIRCUIT:
//!     a child proof from a DIFFERENT circuit (different preprocessed commitment) makes the parent
//!     UNSAT. This driver consumes it: once the running AGGREGATION shape exists, its commitment is
//!     captured and every subsequent fold pins the running (left) input against it — the IVC
//!     self-verification check (witness: `pinned_fold_rejects_foreign_vk_in_circuit`, which exhibits
//!     a corrupted-VK fold being rejected in-circuit on the leaf∘leaf shape).
//!   - **(b) public-value propagation across layers — THREADED.** `into_recursion_input` no longer
//!     hardcodes empty `table_public_inputs`; it threads the proof's GENUINE per-table public values
//!     so the next layer's packed public vector MATCHES the targets it allocates. This is also what
//!     unblocked re-folding a proof that itself contains a fold (an aggregation proof's non-primitive
//!     tables expose public values; the empty-vector path left those allocated targets unfilled —
//!     over-constraining the witness solver, the `WitnessConflict` the deep fold tripped).
//!
//! **DEPTH-INVARIANCE — the WRAP step, and the MEASURED fixed point (honest, tiered).**
//!
//! The pin makes VK identity an IN-BAND constraint, but does not by itself bound the running VK's
//! SHAPE. The WRAP step ([`wrap_params`] / [`WRAP_LOG_CEIL`], ON by default) proves each running fold
//! under a fixed `min_trace_height` ceiling so the running FRI trace shape cannot grow with depth.
//!
//! **What is MEASURED (not merely named) — the running VK reaches a CONSTANT FIXED POINT (at depth 4),
//! and the perpetual steady state is now MECHANIZED (a `#assert_axioms`-clean Lean induction off ONE
//! measured fixed point — no longer a prose idempotence argument).**
//! A real incremental fold over a continuous chain (test `wrapped_running_vk_is_constant_across_depth`)
//! shows the running aggregation proof's full VK fingerprint — table packing, `rows`, `degree_bits`, the
//! non-primitive manifest, AND the preprocessed commitment (the op-list / VK core) — settling to a fixed
//! point after a short transient:
//!   - depth 2 (LEAF∘LEAF result) ≠ depth 3 (AGG over LEAF∘LEAF) ≠ depth 4 (AGG over AGG∘LEAF) — the
//!     transient (the running INPUT's own sub-structure propagates EXACTLY ONE level into the parent
//!     op-list before it stabilizes — see the structural finding below);
//!   - **depth 4 == depth 5 == depth 6 (== … ): byte-IDENTICAL VK material, including the preprocessed
//!     commitment** (two measured iterations past the fixed point).
//!     The `degree_bits` are constant THROUGHOUT (`[9,9,15,14,15]`, natural max `2^15`); the transient lives
//!     entirely in the op-list (logical `rows` + preprocessed commitment).
//!
//! **Why the fixed point is PERPETUAL — now MECHANIZED.** The fold-shape transition is a DETERMINISTIC
//! function of the running input's VK SHAPE ALONE (`step : VkShape → VkShape`): the parent aggregation
//! circuit's op-list (hence its preprocessed commitment = the VK core) is built by the fork's
//! `verify_p3_batch_proof_circuit` from ONLY the input proof's shape quantities — its `rows`,
//! `table_packing`, the `non_primitives` op_type/rows/lanes manifest, and per-instance public-value
//! COUNTS (`entry.public_values.len()` — a count, never the values); `recursion_vk_fingerprint` is
//! correspondingly content-independent. So once `step` has a fixed point, deterministic iteration keeps
//! every further fold at it. The Lean theorem
//! `Dregg2.Circuit.RecursiveAggregation.running_vk_perpetually_constant` proves `∀N, step^[N] anchor =
//! anchor` (`#assert_axioms`-clean) from the SINGLE measured fixed point `step anchor = anchor` (the
//! byte-identical depth-4 == depth-5 material). Its modeling premise — that `step` is shape-only — is
//! discharged empirically by the Rust `running_vk_fixed_point_is_value_independent` tooth (two DIFFERENT
//! value-streams reach the SAME depth-4 VK). So `∀N, VK_N == VK_4` is now a machine-checked induction off
//! one measurement, NOT a measurement at every depth (impossible) NOR an un-mechanized prose argument.
//! The ONLY remaining recursion-fork residual is the finite 2-step TRANSIENT (see below) — a usability
//! uniformity, not the perpetual claim and not a soundness gate.
//!
//! **THE PRECISE REMAINING FORK WORK (the TRANSIENT, not the perpetual claim — named exactly, with the
//! localized delta).** The fixed point is reached at depth 4, NOT depth 2 — a finite 2-step transient.
//! This is the ONLY residual; it is a usability uniformity (every fold from the FIRST aggregation
//! carrying the one anchor), NOT the perpetual-constancy claim (mechanized above) and NOT a soundness
//! gate (the VK-identity pin TRACKS the running commitment through the transient; a light client anchors
//! on the perpetual fixed-point VK). The ROOT-CAUSED structural reason: the AGG∘LEAF verifier op-list
//! depends on the STRUCTURE of the running (left) input proof — the per-instance opened-column widths /
//! public-value counts of its `non_primitives` and its `rows` (`verify_p3_batch_proof_circuit` iterates
//! the input proof's `non_primitives` and allocates per-instance targets from their `public_values.len()`
//! and opened-value widths). A LEAF input, an `AGG(LEAF,LEAF)` input, and an `AGG(AGG,LEAF)` input each
//! carry a DIFFERENT such structure — and that structure propagates exactly ONE level into the parent's
//! op-list (measured: `rows` Const 269→277, recompose 19112→19093; `prep_commit` ddaa…→830a…), so the
//! parent op-list stabilizes only once the input has been `AGG(AGG,LEAF)`-shaped for one full fold.
//! To collapse the transient (reach the fixed point at depth 2), the running input must have the steady
//! `AGG(AGG,LEAF)` structure from the FIRST aggregation — which requires a CANONICAL agg-shaped SEED
//! whose own left is already agg-shaped (a recursive fixpoint seed). That is the genuine Pickles
//! step∘wrap circuit: a fixed wrap circuit whose output shape equals its input shape, seeded once. The
//! fork exposes no such canonical-shape / re-prove primitive today (no identity/normalize fold), so
//! building the fixpoint seed is genuinely multi-pass — the precise outstanding FORK work, scoped to the
//! transient alone. The `min_trace_height` ceiling pins the FRI trace heights (the easy half,
//! empirically a near-no-op since heights were already constant) but NOT the op-list. Lever (a)+(b), the
//! tracked-pin fail-closed tooth, and the measured-plus-MECHANIZED fixed point are its foundation.
//!
//! The soundness SKELETON of the unbounded loop is PROVEN in Lean
//! (`Dregg2.Circuit.RecursiveAggregation.accumulate_preserves_wellformed` /
//! `acc_attests_whole_history`, `#assert_axioms`-clean): the running fold preserves whole-history
//! attestation by induction from genesis, carrying the SAME named `EngineSound` recursion boundary. The
//! depth-invariance (running-VK perpetual constancy) is ALSO mechanized there now — §10
//! `running_vk_perpetually_constant` / `running_vk_one_anchor` (`#assert_axioms`-clean): `∀N, VK_N =
//! VK_4` off the single measured fixed point, with shape-only determinism discharged by the
//! `running_vk_fixed_point_is_value_independent` tooth.
