//! ⚑⚑ **THE IPA CLOSING CHAIN, AS A RECURSION TREE — and the leg that binds `sg` folded into it.**
//!
//! ## Substrate, said out loud (HOUSE LAW #1)
//!
//! **The AIR is Lean-authored.** `dregg-mina-wrap-closing-{seg,final,srs}::v1` are
//! `EffectLower.lowerAir` of `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.MinaWrapClosingAir.{closingSegAir,
//! closingFinalAir, closingRoutedAirOn}`. Not one constraint is authored here: the descriptors,
//! their pins, their manifest and their traces all come out of Lean. Rust proves the artifact and
//! folds it.
//!
//! ## WHAT THIS IS THE OTHER SIDE OF
//!
//! `MinaWrapOpeningGate` proves the IPA opening relation on Mina devnet block 539508 in the
//! KERNEL, and `MinaWrapVerifierAir.opening_is_vacuous_when_sg_is_free` is a theorem that it
//! refutes nothing while `sg` is free. `MinaAccumulatorAir` put the STEP-side accumulator check in
//! a circuit; the closing group equation had none. This is the closing equation, in a circuit, at
//! `ipa.rs`'s own combined MSM with `sg_rand_base = −z₁·rand_base` — the coefficient at which the
//! `sg` base drops out of the equation entirely (`MinaWrapClosingAir.the_combined_check_is_
//! constant_in_sg`) and the SRS leg carries `−z₁·s_r` instead.
//!
//! ## ⚑ THE PI LAYOUT IS THE ACCUMULATOR'S, ON PURPOSE
//!
//! A leaf publishes `acc_in ‖ acc_out` — 96 limbs each, contiguous, in that order — which is
//! `MinaAccumulatorAir`'s layout unchanged, so a fold node `cb.connect`s the left child's outgoing
//! 96 limbs to the right child's incoming ones and the two chains compose with ONE adapter.
//! [`crate::mina_accumulator_fold::ACC_PI_COUNT`] is re-used rather than re-declared: a second
//! spelling of 192 is the "two shapes that agree today" failure in its purest form.
//!
//! ## ⚑ THE ENGINE IS DERIVED, NEVER NAMED
//!
//! [`prove_closing_segment`] takes the engine its CHILD is minted at and derives its own wrap
//! engine with [`recursion_layer_over`]; [`prove_closing_fold`] applies it twice — the fixed point,
//! which is `create_recursion_config()`. No config constant is named at a call site. That is the
//! rule that landed 2026-08-07 and took an accumulator leaf from `298.08 s / 117.79 GiB / LDE 2^26`
//! to `21.63 s / 23.23 GiB / LDE 2^23`, and `recursion-verify/tests/tower_config_law.rs` is what
//! proves the measured object is the deployed one.
//!
//! ## ⚠ WHAT THIS DOES NOT ESTABLISH
//!
//! Every residual of `MinaWrapClosingAir`'s docblock, unchanged and not softened here:
//!
//! 1. The scaling `−z₁·s_r·G_r` runs in the EMITTER, not in the AIR. Circuit / emitter / nowhere,
//!    and there is no fourth place.
//! 2. `c·Q` enters as the published `PI[0..95]`. That it is the block's is a CONSUMER refusal.
//! 3. The challenges `u⃗` are not transcript-bound by anything here.
//! 4. P10 — that passing the closing check implies knowing an opening — is untouched.
//! 5. ⚑ **The row is `PastaCurveSound`'s 3 048-column one, NOT `PastaCurveScheduled`'s 481-column
//!    one.** The scheduled row is 6.34× narrower and 7.18× cheaper in committed cells, and the
//!    recursion cost law is linear in COLUMNS — so this leaf is roughly 7× more expensive than it
//!    needs to be. What blocks the port is that the scheduled layout puts one op per row with a
//!    33-phase shift register, so an accumulator crossing complete-additions needs a carry gated by
//!    the phase selector plus a re-run of `AirCrossRow`'s composition over a chain. That is real
//!    work this module does not do, and it is UNDONE WORK, not a theorem of the model.
