//! The genuine `proof_bind` engine for the `custom` effect — a REAL recursive
//! sub-proof verification, not a bounds check.
//!
//! ## What this closes
//!
//! The deployed `customVmDescriptor2R24` carries one `DescriptorIR2.ProofBind`
//! op binding the Custom row's `custom_proof_commitment` column (var 72) and
//! `custom_program_vk_hash` column (var 68). At the descriptor-IR level the op
//! only *declares* the binding; the in-AIR check is a bounds check
//! (`descriptor_ir2.rs`, `VmConstraint2::ProofBind`), and the EffectVM AIR's
//! Custom leg (`effect_vm/air.rs`) explicitly does NOT verify the external
//! proof — it only records its hash commitment and warns:
//!
//! > "Verifiers MUST independently verify the external proof against the
//! >  committed program VK hash. Without this check, a malicious prover can
//! >  claim any custom_proof_commitment without having a valid external proof."
//!
//! That independent verification is what this module makes a deployed,
//! SDK-reachable, light-client-runnable check. It is the REAL engine the
//! descriptor-semantic toy (`descriptor_ir2.rs::ToyEngine`) modeled: the proof
//! carrier is a genuine [`dregg_circuit::dsl::circuit::CellProgram`] STARK, the verifier
//! accepts exactly the proofs that the program's AIR accepts, and a verifying
//! proof's exposed `(commit, vk)` are the canonical PI-commitment and the
//! program's VK hash.
//!
//! ## The soundness property
//!
//! [`verify_proof_bind`] turns the descriptor's `proof_bind` gate from "the
//! columns are in range" into "the bound proof VERIFIED, its public-input
//! commitment EQUALS the bound `commit` column, and its program VK EQUALS the
//! bound `vk` column." A custom effect carrying a FORGED sub-proof — a
//! non-verifying STARK, a commitment that does not match the proof's public
//! inputs, or a VK that does not match the program — is REJECTED.
//!
//! ## How the sub-proof binds (the two columns)
//!
//! * `custom_program_vk_hash` (8 felts, EffectVM PI `CUSTOM_PROOFS_BASE + i*12 +
//!   0..8`; column 68 in the rotated descriptor) — the program identity, the
//!   32-byte [`CellProgram::vk_hash`] mapped through
//!   [`dregg_circuit::effect_vm::bytes32_to_8_limbs`]. The verifier looks the
//!   program up by this hash; an unknown program fails closed.
//! * `custom_proof_commitment` (4 felts, EffectVM PI `... + 8..12`; column 72)
//!   — [`custom_proof_pi_commitment`] of the sub-proof's public inputs. The
//!   verifier recomputes it from the verified sub-proof's PI and requires
//!   equality; a swapped or fabricated commitment fails closed.
//!
//! Both are bound into the turn hash (`turn::Turn::hash`) via
//! `custom_program_proofs`, so the sub-proof bytes + PI cannot be swapped after
//! the fact without changing the turn identity.
