//! **The dregg-side emitter for the ROOT batch's FRI half** — load the REAL committed
//! whole-history root proof, drive p3's OWN transcript to the exact point `verify_fri` is
//! entered, and emit every field an external (o1js) verifier needs to re-run dregg's ACTUAL
//! FRI low-degree test on dregg's ACTUAL root proof, in CANONICAL form.
//!
//! ```text
//!   cargo build -p dregg-circuit-prove --release --bin root_fri_instance
//!   ./target/release/root_fri_instance [out.json]
//! ```
//!
//! ## What this is, and what its sibling is
//!
//! `root_air_instance.rs` emits the ROOT's per-instance AIR closing equality —
//! `accumulator * Z_H(zeta)^{-1} == quotient(zeta)`, the half that says the opened values
//! satisfy the constraint system. It stops at `zeta`. **This binary is the other half**: it
//! starts where that one stops and emits the half that says those opened values are the
//! openings of LOW-DEGREE polynomials the prover was committed to before `zeta` existed —
//! the PCS batch-combination `alpha`, the 17 commit-phase roots and their `beta`s, the
//! constant final polynomial, and all 38 query chains with their Merkle openings, reduced
//! openings, roll-ins and folds.
//!
//! Neither half is a proof on its own. An o1js verifier that checks only the AIR side is
//! reading numbers a prover chose freely; one that checks only the FRI side is proving a
//! low-degree claim about polynomials nobody constrained. The two files share `zeta` and the
//! opened values, and `openedEvals` is labelled precisely so a lane can see that the number
//! it read as `main[2][17]` on the AIR side is the same number that enters round 0, matrix 2,
//! point 0 here.
//!
//! ## The object
//!
//! `ugc-dregg/tests/fixtures/whole_history_proof.bin` — the committed 3-turn whole-history
//! envelope, `WholeChainProofBytes` (at WHOLE_CHAIN_PROOF_ENVELOPE_V1) — decoded to a `BatchStarkProof<DreggRecursionConfig>`
//! and verified under `turn_chain_root_config()`. The FRI engine is BabyBear /
//! `BinomialExtensionField<_,4>` / Poseidon2-width-16, `log_blowup = 3`, arity 2, 38 queries,
//! 14 bits of query grinding, a CONSTANT final polynomial, and `log_global_max_height = 20`.
//!
//! ## ⚑ THE SELF-CHECKS, AND WHY THEY ARE NOT OPTIONAL
//!
//! A dumper whose transcript replay has drifted emits perfectly plausible JSON that is
//! silently wrong — every number well-formed, every number a different protocol. Nothing is
//! written unless all of the following pass:
//!
//! 1. `verify_recursive_batch_proof_with_config` runs p3's OWN `verify_batch` on the loaded
//!    root. It must accept before a single field is computed.
//! 2. The hand-replayed pre-FRI transcript is validated by handing it to the REAL
//!    `<MyPcs as Pcs<EF, Challenger>>::verify`, started from the mirrored challenger state as
//!    it stood immediately after `sample_zeta`. That call re-observes the opened values,
//!    re-samples the entire FRI transcript and re-checks every Merkle opening and fold chain
//!    itself — so if the mirror or the round structure had drifted from `verify_batch`, it
//!    rejects.
//! 3. Every commit-phase Merkle opening is re-verified with the REAL
//!    `challenge_mmcs.verify_batch`, and every input-batch opening with the REAL
//!    `val_mmcs.verify_batch`, at the index that is emitted for that query.
//! 4. Every query's fold chain must land exactly on `final_poly[0]` (`log_final_poly_len = 0`
//!    means the final polynomial is a constant, so its evaluation at the query point IS
//!    coefficient 0).
//! 5. The 38 query indices must be PAIRWISE DISTINCT, and they are printed. A prior leg in
//!    this repo went green because colliding indices made a substitution falsifier a no-op;
//!    distinctness is asserted here so that failure mode cannot recur silently.
//! 6. `reducedOpenings[0].logHeight == 22` (the initial reduced opening sits at the global max
//!    height, which is what makes the fold chain a statement about the tallest matrix), and
//!    the roll-in schedule is IDENTICAL across all 38 queries.
//!
//! ## ⚑ What pins `challengerStateBeforeFriAlpha`, which is the load-bearing field
//!
//! `challengerStateBeforeFriAlpha` is the `DuplexChallenger`'s full internal state — sponge
//! lanes, input buffer, output buffer — at the instant `verify_fri` is entered, BEFORE FRI's
//! own `alpha` is drawn. An o1js circuit starts its challenger from it and derives `alpha`,
//! the commit-phase `beta`s and the 38 query indices itself; if this state is wrong, everything
//! downstream is wrong and every emitted number still looks fine.
//!
//! Check 2 alone does NOT pin it: the real `pcs.verify` performs its own opened-value
//! observes internally, so it validates the state as of `sample_zeta` and is blind to whether
//! THIS file then replayed those observes in the right order. What pins it is checks 3 and 4,
//! which run the whole FRI verification FROM the emitted state: a wrong state gives a wrong
//! `alpha` (so no query's fold chain reaches `final_poly[0]`), wrong `beta`s (so the
//! commit-phase Merkle openings fail at the folded indices), and wrong query indices (so the
//! input-batch openings fail outright) — and `check_witness(14, query_pow_witness)` is an
//! independent 14-bit test on the state immediately before the first index is sampled.
//! Together they leave only a sponge collision, which is not a drift mode.
//!
//! ## ⚑ Canonical, not Montgomery
//!
//! `MontyField31`'s `Serialize` writes the raw Montgomery limb, which is right for p3↔p3 and
//! WRONG for anyone reading the numbers as field elements. Every value here goes through
//! `as_canonical_u32` — extension elements as 4 base limbs, base elements as one, Merkle
//! digests as 8.
//!
//! ## What is REPLICATED from private p3 code, and why
//!
//! * `p3_fri::verifier::open_input` is private and returns the per-query reduced openings only
//!   transiently, so it is reproduced in [`open_input_replica`] — INCLUDING the real
//!   `input_mmcs.verify_batch` call, so a mis-built round structure dies here rather than in
//!   o1js. `apex_shrink_gnark_export.rs` does the same for the BN254 outer config; this is its
//!   BabyBear sibling.
//! * `p3_fri::verifier::verify_query`'s fold loop is reproduced inline so the intermediate
//!   folded values can be EXPORTED. The fold itself is NOT reimplemented: it calls p3's own
//!   `TwoAdicFriFolding::fold_row`, which is the exact function the verifier's folding
//!   strategy delegates to.
//! * `BatchStarkProver::rebuild_airs_pvs_common` is private, so its AIR/public-value
//!   reconstruction is reproduced in [`rebuild_airs`] (identical to `root_air_instance.rs`'s).
//!   The AIRs are needed for two things only: the transcript's per-instance width binding, and
//!   `main_next_row_columns()` / `preprocessed_next_row_columns()`, which decide whether a
//!   matrix is opened at one point or two.
//! * `WholeChainProofBytes::decode_parts` is private; only its root-proof decode is replicated.
//!
//! ## ⚑ What this file does NOT close
//!
//! * It is a DUMP. It says what p3's verifier reads; it says nothing about whether an o1js
//!   verifier reading it computes the same thing. That is the o1js lane's burden, and the
//!   reason `foldedAfterRound` is emitted per round rather than only at the end: a divergence
//!   should localise to a fold, not to "the chain".
//! * A FRI proof that verifies is not a sound proof. This config's per-fold and query columns
//!   are the ones the Lean ledger reports, the commit-phase term is not in the query column,
//!   and the whole tower inherits the undischarged FRI/STARK soundness floor. "p3 accepted it"
//!   is the resolution at which everything here is stated.
//! * The input-matrix ROWS are emitted, but nothing here says those rows are the rows of the
//!   committed trace beyond what `val_mmcs.verify_batch` says — which is a Merkle membership
//!   claim under a hash this file does not model.
//! * The AIR half is not re-checked here. Run `root_air_instance` for that; the two must agree
//!   on `zeta` and on every opened value, and nothing in this binary enforces that agreement.
//!
//! ## ⚑ It is a `src/bin` target, not an example, deliberately
//!
//! Cargo compiles DEV-DEPENDENCIES for an example, and `dregg-circuit-prove`'s dev-deps reach
//! `dregg-lean-ffi`, whose build script fails closed whenever the Lean tree is mid-edit. This
//! emitter needs nothing outside `[dependencies]`.
