/**
 * `@dregg/sdk` — the authorization-first TypeScript SDK for dregg.
 *
 * Two user-facing nouns and one shape:
 *
 * ```text
 * Identity → .turn() → typed verb builders → .sign() → .submit() → Receipt
 * ```
 *
 * - [`Identity`] — who acts (Ed25519, derived `blake3 derive_key("dregg/0")`
 *   from a 64-byte master seed; same golden vector as the Rust SDK / CLI /
 *   extension).
 * - [`profiles`] — the shared `$DREGG_HOME/profiles` named-identity store
 *   (`dregg id create / list / use`).
 * - [`AgentRuntime`] / [`NodeClient`] — an identity bound to a node;
 *   `runtime.turn()` opens the typed verb builder.
 * - [`TurnBuilder`] / [`AuthorizedTurn`] — the one public turn shape. An
 *   unauthorized act is inexpressible on this surface (the raw vocabulary
 *   is sealed behind `@dregg/sdk/raw`).
 * - [`Receipt`] — the proof-of-execution noun, born proofless, with the
 *   composed full-turn STARK lazily attached.
 * - [`NodeEvents`] — `subscribe(filter)` → `AsyncIterable<Receipt>` over
 *   the node's committed-receipt SSE stream (Last-Event-ID resume,
 *   reconnecting).
 * - [`explainTurn`] / [`renderTurn`] — the anti-blind-signing reading: a
 *   total, semantics-faithful description of exactly what a turn does.
 * - [`program`] — the cell-program constraint atoms
 *   (senderIs / senderInSlot / balanceGte / balanceLte / preimageGate and
 *   anyOf / not / implies composition) with content-addressed factory
 *   descriptors.
 *
 * The **organ nouns** (`docs/ORGANS.md`) are the higher primitives, each the
 * ergonomic TS face of a node service: [`TrustlineClient`] (§1, the bilateral
 * line of credit), [`ChannelsClient`] (§4, the group-key epoch lift),
 * [`MailboxClient`] (§2, a hosted inbox over the relay), and [`AttestedQuery`]
 * (the light-client read surface). The node computes the factory descriptors
 * and seal fan-outs the TS wire layer does not carry; these clients drive
 * them — see each module's "Honest scope" for the node-side/client-side line.
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { Identity, AgentRuntime, profiles } from "@dregg/sdk";
 *
 * const id = profiles.loadActive() ?? Identity.generate();
 * const runtime = new AgentRuntime(id, "https://devnet.dregg.fg-goose.online");
 * await runtime.faucet(500);
 * const signed = await runtime.turn().writeU64(0, 42n).sign();
 * console.log(signed.explain()); // read before you leap
 * const receipt = await signed.submit();
 * console.log("committed:", receipt.turnHash);
 * ```
 *
 * The legacy wasm-bound playground client lives at `@dregg/sdk/wasm`.
