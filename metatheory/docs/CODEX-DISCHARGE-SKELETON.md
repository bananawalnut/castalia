# Codex — the #9 discharge induction skeleton (2026-06-25)

The formal structure for deriving the whole-chain binding (not assuming it). THREE soundness layers, cleanly separated:
1. EngineSound (per-node FRI/STARK) = ASSUMED crypto floor — provides ONLY local statement soundness (leaf_sound, combine_sound), NOT GenuineSeg/whole-history.
2. The induction (subtree_binding: EngineSound -> GenuineSeg) = DERIVED — the ordered-chain binding (THE discharge).
3. PoseidonSegBinding (Poseidon2 collision-resistance) = ASSUMED crypto floor — semantic uniqueness of the ordered digest (the SAME-endpoint case).

I’ll ground this in the repo’s durable record before answering, since this is exactly the kind of soundness claim the project notes warn against reconstructing from memory alone. I’ll read the continuity docs first, then the specific Lean/proof artifacts around the accumulator theorem.

## What this project is, in one breath

dregg: a formally verified distributed object-capability OS. The **Lean kernel is the
executor the node actually runs** (`execFullForestG` via `dregg-lean-ffi`); circuits are
**emitted from Lean** (descriptor JSONs, byte-pinned registry); the assurance case
(`metatheory/Dregg2/AssuranceCase.lean`) states five guarantees + its own coverage; a live
devnet runs at `devnet.dregg.fg-goose.online` (graviton i-0540e3a, EIP 34.224.208.52,
key `~/.ssh/negneg-cq.pem`, token in `/etc/dregg/node.env` there).

## THE ARCHITECTURAL LAWS (ember-set, non-negotiable)

1. **ZERO Rust-authored constraints or AIRs, ever.** All circuits and constraint
   semantics are EMITTED FROM LEAN, formally represented. Rust only interprets
   Lean-emitted byte-pinned artifacts. Coverage gaps → emit from a proved Lean module,
   never author Rust. Differentials are transitional SWAP tools only.
2. **Green or bust.** No CI fallbacks, no last-good pins, no continue-on-error masking.
   A pipeline that ships stale artifacts on failure is worse than a red pipeline.
3. **Rise to meet the claim.** An overclaim found = fix the text AND open the closure
   lane in the same breath. Reported/characterized/carried ≠ closed.
4. **Teach what-is.** Outward docs/site/paper: present tense, first principles, never
   trajectory narration ("52→8 shrank!" is banned). History lives in git.
5. **Correspondence is half of assurance.** The deployed system must sit inside the
   theorems' hypotheses (the spec review named where it doesn't yet: genesis not
   value-empty, fee path, see AssuranceCase's deployment-correspondence section).
6. **WE DO NOT NAME — WE REDESIGN, IMPLEMENT, SHIP** (ember 2026-06-11). A named/
   logged/honest gap is never a deliverable; every caveat arrives with its closure
   lane already running. The "named" inventory is a burn-down list.
7. **Conservation is not correctness; l4v quality.** Specs must be sufficient, not
   just true. No quick fixes. Never `git add -A`. Unsigned commits OK. Never stash.
   Main loop commits; agents never run git. Plain constructive register (language
   design / developer experience framing).

**STANDING PRACTICE (ember 2026-06-12): every named follow-up/residue/closure lane goes
into `HORIZONLOG.md` IN THE SAME BREATH as it is named** — reports and commit messages are
not durable across compaction; the log is the burn-down. Sweep it at every Convergence.

## Where everything is

- **The epoch design**: `docs/REFINEMENT-DESIGN.md` — five decisions: THE HEAP
  (registers + openable sorted-Poseidon2 map; reuses proven cap_root gadgets; the write
  verb's spec always said "heap"; ONE rotation bundles registers-16/heap_root/signed-
  wells/RESERVED-removal/column-compaction/genesis+fee fixes), IDENTITY = a governance
  cell, cells=law/agents=will/receipts=nervous-system, cross-cell reads = verified
  observations, SDK → two nouns + authorization inescapable. Waves R2→R4 sequenced.
- **The language design**: `docs/CELL-PROGRAM-LANGUAGE.md` (the expressiveness uplift).
- **The DSL convergence**: `docs/DSL-ALIGNMENT.md` + its AMENDMENT (law #1 applied).
- **Proof economics**: `docs/PROOF-ECONOMICS.md` (when the lane lands).
- **The dreggrs boundary**: `docs/DREGGRS-SEGREGATION.md` (note: its "kimchi from_dsl
  load-bearing" claim was corrected by the DSL census — the feature is enabled nowhere).
- **The substrate record**: `docs/DREGG3.md` (+ MARATHON), the kernel = 8 verbs in
  `metatheory/Dregg2/Substrate/VerbRegistry.lean` (minimality/completeness theorems).
- **Hands-on**: `QUICKSTART.md` (every command verified live).
- **Memory**: `~/.claude/projects/-Users-ember-dev-breadstuffs/memory/` —
  `project-refinement-epoch.md` is the live resume file; MEMORY.md is the index.

## ⚑⚑⚑ CURRENT STATE (2026-06-20 — Opus 4.8 1M; THE ASSURANCE EPOCH — soundness ground-truthed, the goal = "safely live within dregg")

THE FLIP LANDED long ago (the 2026-06-14 block below is dead history). The work since is a deep ASSURANCE epoch:
the circuit-soundness reckoning closed (the byte-identity "differential" was hiding that `Satisfied2` didn't
denote the deployed verifier — now it does: kernel bridge `decideSatisfied2_iff`, the mapDec oracle DISCHARGED,
the differential runs REAL deployed machinery `Ir2Air::eval` + `verify_global_sum`, the floors proven non-vacuous,
the keystone made whole). A live cross-asset CONSERVATION hole was found + closed (executor path; light-client
bundle PI residual named). The ENMESHMENT CENSUS mapped the whole tower: executor↔spec is WELDED (43 keystones,
all 57 arms; the Lean executor IS production, Rust runs it via FFI), all 30 effects spec-welded, settlement welded
to the apex (one rung), the multi-turn stack now rests on the apex too (EngineSound weld). 72 orphans enmeshed
(their #assert_axioms pins now run); 8 rotted-but-hidden modules found, 2+6 being repaired.

THE LIVE GOAL: **"safely live within dregg"** (ember moving Claude into an autonomous harness inside dregg/deos).
Decomposes into two floors: (1) AUTHORITY — guarantee A circuit-FORCED (a circuit-descriptor edit reds the apex)
for ~26/30 effects + apex-wired for 13; the tail (3 frozen-face cap slots + receiptArchive + heapWrite) is
DRIVING NOW (VK-FREEDOM ERA — VK changes are no longer deploy-gated, just ship the truthful fix). (2) HUMAN/
RECOVERY ("cannot lose your OS") — durability core SOUND (upsert + fail-closed, both paths); the recovery→circuit
binding is the remaining weld. THE GENESIS REFRAME (ember): the persist durability "bug" is a CATEGORY ERROR —
build-time customization → the IMAGE (EROS factory, sealed+attestable ISO), runtime → a TURN; mid-session genesis
mutation can't exist. Phase 1 (dissolve) + Phase 2 (image-builder) building now.

⚑ THE DURABLE RECORD: HORIZONLOG.md top ~400 lines = the true frontier (the rest is closed-but-logged, sweepable).
The memory index + its flagged files. NOT the block below (dead epoch). The frontier is SMALL and fully named:
the soundness tail above + 6 peripheral rotted orphans + the l4v marshal translation-validation (own multi-week
lane) + the apexLowers distributed-modernization (own lane). Devnet redeploy: the SSH box was LOST (2026-06-20);
keep the artifact green + pushed to origin/main, redeploy when a box returns.

## ⚑⚑⚑ (SUPERSEDED ↑ 2026-06-20) CURRENT STATE (2026-06-14 — head `6fb9e8087`, Opus 1M; THE FLIP IS NOT YET READY (walls A/B/C + the wasm-prover decision) + ~16 overnight wide-safe commits)

**THE ROTATION DESCRIPTORS ARE CORRECT + GREEN — the magnesium PROOF work is DONE.** Every cohort effect's
rotated descriptor rotates, source-coherent, axiom-clean (lake `Dregg2` 3922 jobs axiom-clean; the
`effect_vm_rotation_flip` flip test 4/4). The model has STOPPED finding flip-blocking *descriptor* gates.
The night closed the last sub-descriptors: NOTE-SPEND (`cc1e1399c` — rotated nullifier at PI[38] + a
model-found single-spend double-spend guard), CAPABILITY (`f967f39b0` — real-Cell authority digest r23, the
over-grant tooth survives rotation), SETFIELD+BRIDGEMINT (`e9d6e357e` — 3 model-found descriptor mismodels
enforced-fixed), and SOURCE-COHERENCE (`05fe8a500` — the per-effect SetField/Mint SOURCE descriptors
reconciled to runtime, rotated tick-faces proved `:= rfl` EQUAL to source, JSON byte-identical so the live
wire is UNTOUCHED). `setFieldDynV3` is proven STRUCTURALLY UNREACHABLE (coherence-only, not a flip-blocker).

**THE FLIP IS NOT YET READY** (the flip-executor's honest inventory — the flip was ATTEMPTED and correctly
NOT TAKEN: the staged tree is GREEN, NO edits were made). The rotation descriptors being correct+green is
the magnesium PROOF being complete; it is NOT the LIVE-PATH cutover. The earlier "flip-safe, all gates
closed" was an OVER-CLAIM (rise-to-meet-the-claim correction) — §EXEC.3's "WHAT'S STILL GATED" was the
accurate read, and it is UNMET. Three walls + an architecture decision gate even C5-(1):
- **WALL A** — `prove_full_turn` (`sdk/src/full_turn_proof.rs:1042`) calls `generate_effect_vm_trace` (the
  v1 186-col AIR) UNCONDITIONALLY; the rotated leg is an ADDED sub-proof under `witness.rotation.is_some()`,
  and `CutoverFallback` (`:568`) is the live routing. FIX: make the rotated PI the composed-PI / VK-hash
  source so the v1 backbone can go; retire `CutoverFallback`.
- **WALL B** — `verify_aggregated_bundle` (`turn/src/aggregate_bilateral_prover.rs:185`) reads
  `wr.public_inputs[..ACTIVE_BASE_COUNT]` (the v1 PI slice). FIX: carry the 49-felt schedule block in the
  witnessed receipt so the bilateral verify stops reading `effect_vm::pi`.
- **WALL C** — the FLOW-B note-spend freshness arm (`node/src/blocklace_sync.rs:2667`, the
  `(None,Some(nullifier))` arm) calls `prove_and_verify_finalized_turn_freshness` with NO rotation. The
  descriptor is READY (`rotateV3WithNullifierPin`); the gap is the live node wiring + composed-PI binding.
  FIX: thread the rotated nullifier descriptor into that call site.
- **THE WASM-PROVER DECISION (ember's call)** — v1 is the `#[cfg(not(feature="recursion"))]` wasm
  verify+PROVE path; `wasm/src/runtime.rs:710` calls `generate_effect_vm_trace` directly (the in-browser
  prover uses v1, because the IR-v2 prover pulls p3-recursion/DFT crates that don't fit wasm). So C7
  grep-zero (deleting v1) is PROVABLY IMPOSSIBLE while wasm proves in-browser on v1 (134 live refs to
  `generate_effect_vm_trace`, 108 to `EffectVmAir`). **DECIDED (ember, 2026-06-14): Option A** — build a
  wasm-fittable rotated prover (replace the p3-recursion/DFT deps for the in-browser path) so wasm proves on
  rotated TOO → v1 dies EVERYWHERE, true grep-zero, the web keeps in-browser proving. A FRONTIER build added
  to the pre-C7 work (the DFT/recursion-in-wasm problem is real); C7 deletion waits on it.

These four are the REAL gate before C5 can open. A flip-executor agent inventoried (did NOT cut). **The
persvati workspace gauntlet + the held push (~30 commits) + the devnet redeploy remain HELD for ember at the
redeploy point-of-no-return** (the redeploy is ember's act — fresh genesis), behind the four above.

**S5 CLOSED (`ed35b23b2`):** the running node now COMMITS a turn through the ordering rule at n≥2 — finality
fires cross-node (`three_node_ordering_rule.rs` green under `REQUIRE_FINALITY=1`; n=3 CONVERGED `latest_height
1 1 1`). Four measured defects closed (Dandelion stem misroute · chain-not-round DAG · half-duplex gossip
connections [the root cause] · finalized-turn double-apply). This is the distributed thesis, RUNNING. A
faucet/finalized-execution production-hardening pass is the named follow-up (lane running; devnet-correct
today, NOT blocking).

**~16 OVERNIGHT WIDE-SAFE COMMITS** (while the flip is held, a 5-lane braid — each green by file set, each
naming its honest scope-limit in HORIZONLOG): cli `DREGG_HOME` hermetic config + preflight (`9427a18e5`/

`b7ff641bc`/`0fc7912f7`/`2f3f47ad4`/`15fc03fb6`).

**MILESTONE STATUS:** silver / magnesium / gold **STRONG** (magnesium is **PROOF-complete** — descriptors
correct+green; the LIVE path is GATED on walls A/B/C + the wasm-prover decision before the graduated path
becomes the default). diamond **IN PROGRESS** — the named gap is the **l4v BINARY BRIDGE** (two
obligations: translation-validation of `dregg-lean-ffi/src/marshal.rs` as a THEOREM `marshal_turn_hosted =
encodeWWire ∘ lift`, the codec-in-TCB seam; + the Lean→C/`.a` link correspondence that the linked
`libdregg_lean.a` IS the `@[export]`ed Lean. Stage 0 = invert `turn/src/lean_apply.rs:~1143` to make Lean
authoritative, "no new mathematics"). devnet-golden **CLOSE** — the node commits at n>1; the redeploy is
held for ember. The forward work is captured in **`docs/NEXT-WAVE.md`** (ready-to-fire, each with its lever).

## ⚑⚑⚑ (SUPERSEDED ↑) CURRENT STATE (2026-06-13 LATE — head `d4adcc765`, Opus 1M; the REFINEMENT BRAID — 5 commits banked, cutover at C4, notify FINISHED)

ember's mode: **BRAIDS not waves** ([[feedback-braids-not-waves]]) — finish a cluster, immediately launch/integrate the obvious next; the main loop is a continuous launcher+integrator (commits agent drafts by file set); **proofs are subagent work**. A full 20-doc orientation pass is done (notify · pg-dregg · desktop-OS · seL4 · assurance-critique · cutover · starbridge).

**LANDED this session (5 commits, all green + axiom-clean):**
- `d51dc74df` **cross-cell imports** (`Authority/CrossCellImport.lean` — gap 6, "the deepest naturalness gap", DISSOLVED: an import cites a source receipt + the value its field held there; the crown `importValid_stable_under_source_advance` proves a past-snapshot import is I-CONFLUENT where a live read is not; tamper-evidence inherited from `Exec.Receipt.chain_tamper_evident`, HInj/HFresh stay named hyps) + **2 real integrator-wedge apps** (`Apps/{AgentOrchestrationBudget,EscrowDeskCouncil}.lean` — the six primitives buildr/builders/sig/simbi hand-roll, lamesauce refuted, teeth both polarities).
- `d70046a88` + `bae653495` **CUTOVER C4**: the two recursion consumers + the FLOW-B SDK leg rewired onto the rotated leaf-wrap; the **bilateral aggregation AIR EMITTED FROM LEAN** (`Circuit/Emit/EffectVmEmitBilateralAgg.lean` + a NEW two-row `windowGate` IR-v2 primitive in `DescriptorIR2.lean`; soundness teeth `agg_rejects_turn_mismatch`/`agg_rejects_bad_agent_count`).
- `3ffc3af0c` **cell-program language atoms** (`Exec/Program.lean`: `senderMemberOf` + `affineDeltaLe` + `balanceDeltaLe/Ge` — the apps-surfaced expressiveness; the flash-well `BalanceDeltaGte` twin now landed).
- `d4adcc765` **NOTIFY STEP 2 FINISHED** (staged — VK **BYTE-IDENTICAL**, no cap emits `[.notify]` yet): the `Auth.notify` ctor (`Authority/Positional.lean`) + α total on all 7 seL4 IPC authorities + NotifyAuthority re-bound onto the real Auth (`notifyCap_confers_no_edge`) + the full ripple (rise-to-the-claim: found 2 "every Auth" sites the divergence-finding missed) + `Firmament/SeL4Composition.lean` (a dregg turn in a PD preserves BOTH the seL4 cap-space invariant AND dregg non-amp, same grantOk witness). The VK-touching tail (cap-leaf badge-mask + verifier re-pin) rides the cutover's ONE VK epoch — `docs/NOTIFY-STEP2-VK-CHECKLIST.md`.

**LIVE BRAID (running):** cutover-tail relaunch (`a99329b58` — the bilateral Rust interpreter [decode `windowGate` + restructure the WR 49-felt schedule block + rewire `aggregate_bilateral_prover.rs`, retire `bilateral_aggregation_air.rs`] + node FLOW-B producer threading + the ~70 call-sites → C5 regen → **C7 delete v1 + grep-zero**; C5/C7 = the coordinated VK-epoch **SETTLE the main loop runs**, batching notify's felt-encoders) · apps-round-2 (rebuild weak toy apps on the new expressiveness).

**HELD for the cutover-settle:** starbridge-v2 **A2 swarm surface** (`swarm.rs` — the notify async edge; blocked ONLY by the known **p3-recursion fork seam** — starbridge-v2 + sel4 are separate workspaces lacking the breadstuffs `[patch]`; fix = push the fork `72ffc56` + retarget revs + drop the local patch) · the notify VK-batch · the dead-pg-dregg-agent draft (pg-dregg M3 is post-flip anyway, but M2+Tier-C are LIVE on pg18).

**THE l4v ROADMAP (post-cutover, `ASSURANCE-CRITIQUE.md` §5):** the Lean composition is strong (`deployed_system_secure` apex; unfoolability derives conservation). The distance to l4v-grade is the **binary bridge** — **Stage 0 = make the verified executor authoritative (invert `turn/src/lean_apply.rs:1143`, "no new mathematics")**; Stages 1-6 = spec→binary refinement / discharge `leaf_sound` / tie the apex to one turn / native UC / n>1 consensus (**S5-1** = the gossip-dissemination blocker, `docs/STAGE5-CONSENSUS-DEVAC.md`) / config-pin the crypto floor. seL4 step-4 is DONE (the verified executor runs a turn inside a booted PD).

## ⚑⚑⚑ (SUPERSEDED ↑) CURRENT STATE (2026-06-13, head db046eaf2 — Opus, +20 commits; CUTOVER C1+C2 LANDED · C3 WALLED+SCOPED · REORIENTING TO THE DESKTOP-MESHING DEVNET)

A long brave-fanout continuation (~18 commits, persvati-gauntlet-green incl. the v8→v9 cap-crown ripple).
Landed: the Gerwin-Klein critique (`docs/ASSURANCE-CRITIQUE.md`) + **Klein CRITICAL-2 (wire codec) CLOSED both
halves** (Lean `Refine.lean` export-refines-model + the Rust marshaller conformance-gated to the proof); the
composed `deployed_system_secure` apex + conserves-from-verification (#2/#3); **cap-crown #103 finished as the
cutover gate** — RevokeCapability graduated (in-circuit non-amp + cell-TOMBSTONE binding; cap-root v2→v3,
commitment v8→v9) + Custom graduated via a new **`ProofBind` recursive-binding IR constraint** → **THE ROTATION
RESIDUE IS EMPTY** (all ~36 effects rotate); **the verified Lean executor RUNS a real turn on aarch64**
(`3f188ef60` — ELF Lean runtime from lean4@d024af099, status:2 accepted, anti-ghost holds; remaining = host on
the seL4 root-task-with-std substrate); an n=3 consensus slice runs the ordering rule (frontier = gossip
dissemination, `docs/STAGE5-CONSENSUS-DEVAC.md`); pg-dregg PgSink + starbridge cipherclerk/⌘K-palette.

⚑⚑ THE CUTOVER — C1+C2 LANDED (`0db2e44e8`), C3 IS A REAL WALL (the recursion knot), and its closure lane is RUNNING.
The rotated path is PROVEN end-to-end (all 36 effects rotate; residue EMPTY) and the sovereign matched pair is
live-green with the MEASURED win (350.5 KiB → 120.4 KiB, −65.6%, verify 3.4×). **C1** = sovereign FLOW-A produce+verify
rotated (`cipherclerk::prove_sovereign_turn_rotated` ↔ `executor::verify_and_commit_proof_rotated`, hand-AIR retired
on that path; new default-on `recursion` feature, wasm `not(recursion)` keeps v1). **C2** = prover-free verify split
(`verifier` feature on dregg-circuit compiles `verify_vm_descriptor2` without the prove_batch/DFT link). **C3 = THE
HARD WALL** (NOT a disempowerment — confirmed by reading the code): the live full-turn proof and the recursion layer
are ONE KNOT. `prove_full_turn` mints the `EffectVmP3Proof` that THREE LIVE recursive surfaces re-prove as the v1
186-col statement — `circuit/src/ivc_turn_chain.rs:507` (lightclient WholeChainProof, in-circuit *uni*-STARK leaf-wrap),
`circuit/src/joint_turn_aggregation.rs:67/94` (aggregation AIR on `EffectVmAir::new` directly), `turn/src/
aggregate_bilateral_prover.rs` (node bilateral bundle). There is **no in-circuit verifier / leaf-wrap for the rotated
MULTI-TABLE `BatchProof`** in the recursion fork, so the live proof can't rotate and v1 can't be deleted while they
stand. THE DECISION (ember's): (a) build the batch-proof recursion wrap · (b) re-architect the whole-history recursion
· (c) freeze a v1 leaf for the recursion layer while the live single-turn path rotates (double-mint). **DECISION-ENABLER
RUNNING:** background workflow `wong1ps3v` (`c3-batchproof-recursion-scope`) — three readers (recursion-fork in-circuit
primitives · what `verify_batch` actually checks · the three consumers' minimal needs) → a tractability verdict
(bounded-build vs fork-surgery) + a/b/c recommendation. Read its result before making the call. (Advances Klein CRITICAL-1.)

⚑ THE REORIENTATION (2026-06-13): the desktop-meshing devnet does NOT need v1 deleted to ship — it runs on the live
path (v1 proofs are fine for a devnet) and flips to rotated the instant the knot releases. So: point attention at the
devnet (firmament `Target::Surface` + starbridge-v2 + the seL4 step-4 substrate, lane `ae3d052e` running), and let the
C3 scope verdict decide whether v1 dies BEFORE or AFTER first deploy. Only build the (c) double-mint if we want
rotated-live proofs before the (a) wrap lands. pg-dregg is now pg18-native (`db046eaf2`).

DONE-BUT-DEFERRED: pg-dregg LIVE pg17 confirm-run (code green, blocked on the local lock); the warnings-import
sweep (protocol-tests/tests/teasting unused imports); the cap-crown `EmitCapRoot` doc note + the Phase-D 4-ary-leg
ember-decision (HORIZONLOG). KLEIN §5 l4v roadmap: Stage 0 (executor authority) is next-after-cutover; Stages 1-6
in ASSURANCE-CRITIQUE.md §5.

## ⚑⚑⚑ (SUPERSEDED by CURRENT STATE above) head a0d0d45d3 — cutover-parked / cap-crown-the-gate snapshot

Resumed post-compaction; landed 8 commits by file set (each narrow-verified):
`34dbca54a` starbridge-v2 coverage · `29c51bde3` metatheory assurance frontiers + Klein #2/#3

⚑ THE CUTOVER IS PARKED at step-1 by EMBER DECISION (2026-06-13): **"finish cap-crown #103 first."**
Step 2 (the live-path rewrite, ~70 call-sites + executor PI reconstruction) is NOT started. Full
v1-deletion is HARD-GATED on 2 residue effects: **RevokeCapability (sel 24)** — needs its in-circuit
cap-root advance from the cap-crown reshape (#103); **Custom (sel 8)** — needs a new accumulator
constraint kind the per-row IR lacks. Sequence: cap-crown #103 → unblocks RevokeCapability → ONE
clean cutover deletes v1 entirely (no fallback tail). A read-only cap-crown state-mapping agent is
running (A-F stages + the RevokeCapability critical path); plan/launch the cap-crown completion off it.
The parked cutover checkpoint is `a0d0d45d3`; ROTATION-CUTOVER.md §2c/§3 has the precise remaining steps.

## NOW-STATE (late-2026-06-25 cluster — lanes that landed AFTER the entries below, recorded here for durability)
- ANDROID cap-graph COMPLETED: the whole ambient-AOSP surface reforged as cap-bounded gates — intent
  (`intentgate.rs` `76165ec4`, transport leg `63dfdca3`), content-providers (`contentgate.rs` `7451f6a6`),
  system-services→organs (`organgate.rs` `af7d1c00`), install=cap-gated-birth (`appfactory.rs` `63dfdca3`).
  The permission model is REAL: visible cap-badges (`e826335e`), a dangerous-perm hand-over mints a genuine
  `Effect::GrantCapability` over the verified executor (`542f640d`, `turn/src/action.rs:962`), and the confined
  app's `checkSelfPermission` is interposed over the cap-badge set + DENIED in-runtime on a dim cap (`d9a2ffc8`).
  SystemUI cap-chrome rendered ON THE GLASS for a focused AndroidCell window — status bar + quick-settings shade +
  hand-over sheet, a tap drives a REAL `Effect::GrantCapability`, the badge flips lit (`d361cfc5`/`76b43970`).
  NAMED TAIL: a clean painted gpui frame on-device still needs real arm64 Vulkan hw (emulator GPU wall, not a bug).
- SERVICE CELLS: three citizens on `invoke()` — kvstore (`0d1a3f8b`), nameservice (`21afb73c`), escrow-market
  (`d124ad8a`, first four-organ non-trivial). Non-degrading: identical canonical program ⇒ organ teeth re-enforce
  on every desugared turn, cap-gate bites at front-door AND executor. No `Effect::Invoke`, no kernel change.
- MATCHING faithfulness FULLY CLOSED both deployed paths: derivative determinizer (`Determinize.lean`) + legacy
  Thompson (`c14aa325`, `Thompson.lean` sorry-free); inter/neg route through the determinizer (`compiler.rs:692`).
- UMEM: the whole-image FOLD CHIP landed in-circuit (`74565bd5`, `dregg-circuit::whole_image_fold` discharges
  fc679a5f's `hpin`). NAMED TAIL: the universal-map rotation flip (umem becomes the prover — `umem_witness_enabled`
  still defaults FALSE, `turn/src/executor/mod.rs:815`) → Stage B heap-write effect.
- FIRMAMENT: the semihost interactive cockpit now runs the REAL verified `DreggEngine` (live-repaint-on-turn,
  `251692b7`) — closes `SEL4-INTERACTIVE-COCKPIT.md §3.5`. NAMED TAIL: §3.6 step 4, the executor-PD's bare-metal
  Lean-ELF runtime link (the real-seL4 WALL; gated on Microkit SDK on PATH, not a semihost blocker).
- MULTIPLAYER: a real two-instance session — two co-inhabitants sync via the membrane's field-granular stitch
  (`8159d322`). SURFACES: the Spotter + menus now reach EVERY session surface, each landing mold-ready (`f7e6765a`).

## ⚑ THE UMEM ROTATION-FLIP BURN-DOWN (the 5-rank plan, named in `6ec89500` + `UNIVERSAL-MAP-ROTATION.md`)
*(The flip = make the universal-memory prover LOAD-BEARING on the wire: `umem_witness_enabled`
still defaults FALSE (`turn/src/executor/mod.rs:815`), v1 is still the only prover. Each rank
carries its closure shape. Pure-Lean ranks are VK-risk-free and can soak before any flag-day.)*
- RANK 1 — the umem ADDRESS/VALUE CODEC ADAPTERS (the gating long pole, VK-RISK-FREE). ✅ DONE
  (`metatheory/Dregg2/Crypto/UMemCodec.lean`, 17 theorems `#assert_axioms`-clean): the REAL
  structured carriers replacing `effect_vm_umem_real_turn.rs`'s per-proof "dense injective
  relabeling" — `uaddrEnc=hash[domainTag d, coll, key]` + `uaddrEnc_injective` (the structured
  address codec, faithful under CR + injective tag); `capLeafOf=hash[holder,target,rights,op]` (=
  the deployed `siteCapEdgeLeaf` by `rfl`) + value codec WHERE/WHAT split + `capRoot_injective`
  (the cap boundary root binds its 4-felt cap cells, no new combinatorics); the MMR
  boundary-derivation analogue for the index domain (`index_boundary_root_{derived,bound,
  from_memcheck}`, riding `mroot_injective` + `memcheck_pins_final`). All on the SAME named
  `Poseidon2SpongeCR` floor (no narrower bit-count), non-vacuity both polarities on `refSponge`.
- RANK 2 — the `absent` map-op realization (`descriptor_ir2.rs:62-68`, declared in IR / refused by
  assembly today; the nullifier-insert lane needs it regardless). CLOSURE: assembly + a refuse-test.
- RANK 3 — the 3-verb EXECUTOR (the runtime long pole): `RecordKernelState` → the ONE universal
  map (`VerbCompression.lean:87-89` "rides THE ONE ROTATION"; `turn/`+`cell/`-shaped). The 3-verb
  circuit descriptors GATE on this — circuit semantics must not run ahead of runtime semantics.
- RANK 4 — the per-domain WHOLE-IMAGE fold-chip generalization: the cap/nullifier/index boundary
  folds reconciled against the universal boundary table (the `6ec89500` whole-image chip is the
  heap-plane proof-of-shape; extend to the other domains via the Rank-1 codecs). Still
  `umem_witness_enabled`-gated.
- RANK 5 — the LAYOUT FLAG-DAY (one motion, AFTER GATE 0 = IR-v2 size GREEN): registers 8→16 +
  `FactoryDescriptor.fields` · `heap_root`+`iroot` commitment limbs (`CommitBindsIndex`/
  `CommitBindsMMR`) · PI v3 · RESERVED/selector-block death · universal-memory table assembly →
  ONE descriptor regen → differential gauntlets (cell≡circuit per map · per-effect AGREE · the
  memory-argument adversarial suite, `UniversalMemory.lean` §6 as the templates) → VK/commitment
  bump → succession drill → persvati gauntlet → deploy when ember says deploy.

## web-deos DEEPENED: a SERVICE CELL invoked node-less in the browser (2026-06-25)
- WHAT: the web `ViewNode` path gained a fourth, richer surface — a KV-store SERVICE CELL driven entirely in a
  browser tab (`wasm/src/bindings_card.rs::KvStoreWorld` + `deos-view/src/web.rs::render_kvstore_live_document` +
  `deos-view/examples/web_render_card.rs` bakes `kvstore.html` + a gallery tile). Unlike counter/inspector/tally
  (bare `SetField` on a cell's own slots), the store publishes a typed `InterfaceDescriptor` (put·delete·get);
  clicking put/del ROUTES through `route_method` (the verified `dregg_dfa` router) BEFORE desugaring to the
  version-bump + register `SetField`s — no `Effect::Invoke`. `runtime::app_programs::kvstore_program` (Monotonic on
  the version slot, mirrors `starbridge_kvstore` which can't be a wasm dep) is installed on the store cell; the
  caller is a separate agent granted a reach cap. `tryRollback` proves the Monotonic guarantee BITES in-tab (a real
  executor refusal: "field[0] decreased"); `tryGet` proves get is the named Serviced OFE seam. VERIFIED by running:
  wasm-pack build + served + `scripts/drive-deos-kvstore.mjs` headless-Chrome CDP driver — all asserts pass
  (put 20→21, del 10→0, version 4→5→6, rollback refused, get named; receipts 5→6→7). Commit `f956a9514`.
- NAMED TAILS (closure shape): (a) `put`'s value is currently a single-arg "bump the register" (the ViewNode
  `Button` carries one `arg`); a richer put-with-explicit-value needs a text `Input`-bound value affordance (the web
  renderer already renders `Input`, just not yet wired to fire a 2-arg method). (b) `get`'s Serviced answer is
  NAMED-and-refused, not yet SERVED — closure = surface the OFE cross-cell-read result as a (read-only) bound row
  when the serviced-answer carrier (S2) lands. (c) the in-tab service-cell is wasm-mirrored (program VALUE +
  invoke() routing core re-expressed), like the subscription/governance app programs; if `starbridge_kvstore` ever
  sheds its axum/tokio deps it could be a direct wasm dep instead.

## deos-desktop document-collaboration UX DEEPENED: drivable branch→diverge→stitch→conflict→resolve + the umem boundary surfaced (2026-06-25)
- WHAT: the deos_desktop document-language surface (`starbridge-v2/src/deos_desktop/mod.rs`) is now drivable end to end:
  (a) a LIVE co-author draft editor — a second `InputState` (`branch_inputs`/`branch_subs`) so the co-author TYPES the
  divergence by hand (`set_branch_text` as `author^1`), not only the canned button; (b) the document's UMEM-HEAP BOUNDARY
  (`DocHeapCell::from_graph(...).commitment()`) is read out and watched MOVE through edit/branch/stitch/resolve — the
  conflict's boundary is labelled "binds both alternatives" (the anti-forge tooth surfaced); (c) richer ConflictView —
  alternatives attributed you-vs-co-author (`author_label`), a RESOLVED receipt row (the resolution patch id = the turn's
  receipt, `last_resolution`). New bake `--render-doc-collab` drives the whole flow on one large editor window + asserts the
  boundary moves, the conflict is held off-heap, and resolve publishes (height grows, receipt lands, boundary moves).
- NAMED TAILS (closure shape): (a) CLOSED 2026-06-25 (`83352a35d`) — `edit_doc` now persists the document INTO the cell's
  umem-heap (`commit_doc_to_umem_heap` → `DocHeapCell::from_graph_with_text` → `World::set_cell_heap`, an out-of-band
  `set_heap`/`reseal_heap_root`, no kernel effect), so the cell's committed `heap_root` IS the document commitment (boundary ==
  commitment, surfaced via `live_doc_boundary`); prose re-seeds on reopen from `dregg_doc::COLL_TEXT` (the one-way BLAKE3
  projection stays recoverable). Conflict/stitch/resolve ride the same heap. RESIDUAL (durable-image seam): `set_cell_heap`
  fail-fasts on a durable image whose doc cell a committed turn already touched (the genesis-mirror-after-turn guard) — the
  demo world is ephemeral so it passes, but a DURABLE runtime heap write awaits an ordered heap effect (no `Effect::SetHeap`
  exists; mirrors the `set_cell_program` runtime-vs-genesis tension). (b) the live branch editor re-seeds only on creation; a
  programmatic diverge after the widget exists needs a `branch_resync` (mirror of `doc_resync`) — closure = add it if a flow
  edits the branch out-of-band while its editor is open.

## polyana seam WIRED: `polyana-bridge` realizes the sketch against real dregg cores (2026-06-25)
- WHAT: `docs/deos/polyana-seam-sketch.rs` (was "ILLUSTRATIVE, NOT WIRED") is now the `polyana-bridge` crate
  (workspace member). Slice 3 = `gate_effect_set`/`gate_auth` over the PROVEN `is_facet_attenuation`/`is_attenuation`;
  Slice 1 = `witness_receipt` → real chained `dregg_turn::TurnReceipt` (v3 hash binds the chain link); Slice 1's payoff =
  `attest_whole_log` + `dregg_query` `AttestedAnswer` non-omission certificate. 7 tests green (`polyana-bridge/tests/seam.rs`).
- NAMED TAILS (closure shape): (a) the EffectMask bit-assignment is the bridge's polyana-vocab intern, NOT dregg protocol
  bits — extend `POLYANA_EFFECT_BITS` as polyana's vocabulary grows (≤32 tokens, `u32`); promote to a richer set type if it
  outgrows that. (b) `audit_records` leaves `EffectSummary`s empty — wire polyana's typed effect summaries (fn_name/intent
  kind → `EffectSummary`) so the attested queries see real facts, not just the receipt-hash MMR. (c) ACTUAL adoption is in
  polyana's own repo (`~/pug/polyana`, read-only here): a `pa_witness` call site that also emits the bridge receipt + a
  `cap-bundle` parser → `CapBundle` — an ember/David seam, out-of-tree. (d) Slice 2 (`Target::HostPd` confinement) stays in
  `sel4/dregg-firmament`, not re-exported.

## umem Stage A LANDED: the per-cell heap is a first-class umem (additive); live producer is the named seam (2026-06-25)
- WHAT: `UMEM-PRIMITIVE.md §2/§7` Stage A — the per-cell heap (`CellState.heap_map`) projected as a
  first-class umem collection, additive on the recursion-gated bridge witness, the keystone's first
  cross-cell consumer. Shipped in `turn/`:
  - `UKey::Heap { cell, collection, key }` (heap domain) + `project_cell` emits one `UVal::Bytes32`
    per `heap_map` entry. `heap_root` is now the DERIVED commitment of the `Heap` plane (NOT
    separately projected — exactly the established `fields_root`/`Field` treatment; the sorted-
    Poseidon2 root over the projected cells EQUALS `cell.state.heap_root` by `boundary_root_derived`).
  - `JournalEntry::SetHeap` + `record_set_heap` + rollback + `touches_of_entry` → genuine `umem_op`
    rows on a heap write (the bridge re-reads a journaled heap write as its Blum WRITE).
  - `open_heap_against_committed` — the cross-cell read: binds another cell's committed `heap_root`
    as an init image and opens a key; a tampered preimage derives a different root → the binding
    REFUSES (the Rust shadow of the keystone `boundary_init_root_bound`).
  - reify_seam RESIDUAL #1 CLOSED: `reify_cell` rebuilds `heap_map` from the `Heap` plane + re-derives
    `heap_root`; a non-empty heap now round-trips. Tests: `turn/src/umem.rs` `heap_stage_a_tests` (3) +
    `turn/tests/umem_time_travel.rs::reify_round_trips_non_empty_heap`. All umem suites green.
- NAMED SEAM (closure lane, not parking): no live `Effect` journals a heap write yet — today the heap
  is mutated out-of-band (`CellState::set_heap`, e.g. `deos-js`/`dregg-doc`). The producer is a
  heap-writing effect = a NEW effect/circuit surface (Stage B+, with `UmemRef`/checkpoint), deliberately
  NOT built here. `JournalEntry::SetHeap` + `record_set_heap` carry `#[allow(dead_code)]` until it lands.
  Named in `turn/src/journal.rs` (the `SetHeap` NAMED SEAM doc).

## DERIVATIVE-MATCHING faithfulness: Stages 0/1/3 LANDED kernel-clean over dregg's Pred; Stage 4 language-half done, table-equality unblocked (2026-06-25)
- WHAT: a Brzozowski/Antimirov symbolic-derivative matcher built over dregg's OWN `Pred` algebra
  (`PredRE` = ERE≤'s `RE` minus the four lookarounds, `Pred` leaf), in dregg's own Lean — ERE≤ +
  ITP'25 `finiteness-derivatives` read as proof BLUEPRINTS only (no import; cloned to `~/dev/_research/`).
  All `#assert_axioms`-clean (`{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`), zero `sorry`. Modules:
  `metatheory/Dregg2/Crypto/Deriv/{Core,Correctness,Similarity,Determinize,Combinatorics,TTerm,Permute,
  SymbolicDerivative,Pieces,Finite,Monotone,Finiteness}.lean` (wired into `Dregg2.lean`).
  - Stage 0 (`Core`): `der`/`null`/`derives` + denotational `Matches` (starMetric termination) + non-vacuity `#guard`s (incl. the new `neg` deny-filter).
  - Stage 1 (`Correctness`): `correctness : derives w R = true ↔ Matches w R` — the "weeks in the design" middle theorem (seven per-ctor lemmas + the Kleene-star tower).
  - Stage 3 (`Finiteness.der_finite`): **Brzozowski FINITENESS** `∃ xs, ∀ {n}, steps r n ⊆[≅] xs` — the whole symbolic-derivative state space fits up to similarity in the fixed finite `⊕(pieces r)`. The full ITP'25 tower (TTerm/symbolic-derivative/pieces/neSubsets/Permute-nodup/`step_to_pieces`/`pieces_equiv'`) ported over `Pred`. `sim_sound` (`Similarity`) proves `≅` is language-sound so the finite ≅-quotient = finite recognized languages. (`DecidableEq PredRE` is CLASSICAL — kept clean.) The design rated this "months, not days"; it landed.
  - Stage 4 (`Determinize`): the derivative automaton presented AS the in-circuit `Dfa.lean` `DfaAccepts` run — `derivativeDfa_correct/_matches` (accepts ↔ `derives` = `Matches`); the in-circuit `Dfa.lean` cascade is IMPORTED, untouched.
- NAMED FOLLOW-UPS (closure lanes, not parking):
  - **Stage 4 table faithfulness — SUBSTANTIVELY CLOSED** (`Deriv/TableDfa.lean`): `tableDfa_faithful` proves ANY flat-table DFA (model of `compiler.rs::Dfa::matches`) whose `accepts` agrees with `derives` on every word decides EXACTLY `Matches R` — the compiled table's boolean meaning is now a THEOREM, construction-agnostic (the table-opaque regime the design says suffices). `tableRun_dfaAccepts` bridges the deployed AIR's relation-δ to a table FUNCTION (closes `DfaAcceptanceAir` GAP-A). `derivativeMatcher_faithful` + `der_finite` give the faithful table EXISTS + is FINITE. RESIDUAL (optional, narrow): a Lean MODEL of `compiler.rs::determinize`'s powerset construction proving ITS `accepts` agrees with `derives` — only needed to name the DEPLOYED table specifically; any agreeing table is already trusted by `tableDfa_faithful`. Named in `Deriv/{TableDfa,Determinize}.lean`.
  - **Stage 5 stateful `(old,new)` carrier** (policy/caveat trace) — gated open research; the binding soundness constraint is the right-skew (derivatives decide LANGUAGE; `FlowRefine.decideRefines` decides reactive SIMULATION; never conflate). Named in `docs/deos/DERIVATIVE-MATCHING-DESIGN.md §5.3`.

## `invoke()` + the SERVICE EXPLORER LANDED end-to-end in deos; serviced-answer + registry-wire are the named follow-ups (2026-06-25)
- WHAT: cells-as-service-objects INVOCATION shipped at the userspace layer (NO kernel `Effect::Invoke`, Effect enum
  untouched), end-to-end into the live deos cockpit:
  1. `dregg_app_framework::invoke` (`app-framework/src/invoke.rs`) — the front door: resolves a method against a cell's
     interface (derive-from-program OR an `InterfaceRegistry`), routes via the verified DFA `route_method`, cap-gates on
     `MethodSig::auth_required` (`InvokeAuthority` tiers), refuses Serviced methods as the named seam, desugars to an
     ordinary method-targeting `Action` + fires through the executor. 5 unit tests.
  2. `starbridge_v2::service_explorer::ServiceExplorer` (`starbridge-v2/src/service_explorer.rs`) — the deos-interior
     Postman-like model (gpui-free, 6 tests): discover→list→invoke off the live `World`, re-inspecting the post-state.
     New executor-entry `World::wrap_action_turn` (preserves the action's method symbol).
  3. The `🛰 SERVICES` cockpit tab (`cockpit/{mod,construct,nav,panels_workspace,panels_moldable}.rs`) — method list +
     args presets + underlying-effect picker + invoke buttons + outcome banner; `Tab::ServiceExplorer` registered, nav
     capture/restore, `CycleServiceFocus`. The `service` anchor boots publishing {ping,set_status,tick}. Verified by a
     headless render of the live element tree (the published methods + invoke affordances paint). 713 lib tests green.
- NAMED FOLLOW-UPS (closure lanes, not parking):
  - SERVICED-ANSWER CARRIER — a `Serviced` method's answer rides the OFE cross-cell-read (`crossCellRead_refines_observedField`);
    today both `invoke()` and the explorer REFUSE it in-band (the seam). The receipt shape that witnesses the serviced
    reads + produced result (so a light client re-checks a service answer) is the build. (Named in `cell/src/interface.rs` S2 list.)
  - REGISTRY WIRE-THROUGH — the cockpit explorer resolves derive-from-program only (`invoke`); the richer
    `InterfaceRegistry`/`build_with_descriptor` + `invoke_with_descriptor` (Signature-gated / Serviced methods) are built
    and tested but not yet surfaced in the cockpit (no UI to register a descriptor). Wire a registry panel.
  - METHOD CLEARTEXT NAMES — a `MethodSig` carries only the symbol; the explorer shows short-hex. A name-registry (or
    carrying the cleartext alongside the descriptor) would show {ping,…} instead of {53ee61…}. Cosmetic, userspace.
  - ARGS ENTRY — the args field uses preset buttons (the cockpit's text idiom); a live text input is the richer UX.

## mid-forest `yield_point` LANDED; promise-pipelining lift of the live yield is the named follow-up (2026-06-25)
- WHAT: the continuations lane's "THE SEAM — mid-forest checkpoint" is CLOSED. `TurnExecutor::maybe_umem_yield`
  (called from `executor/execute_tree.rs` after each effect appends to the journal) snapshots
  `project_executor_state(ledger)` LIVE between two effects when armed via `set_umem_yield_at`; the snapshot lands in
  `last_umem_yield`. `Continuation::from_yield` BINDS the live boundary to the committed Blum trace (admits only a
  snapshot equal to a trace-prefix fold; refuses foreign). Lean twin `Dregg2/Exec/Continuation.lean`:
  `midturn_split`/`yield_resume_sound`/`resumed_tail_disciplined`, 7 keystones `#assert_all_clean`. Tests:
  `turn/tests/mid_forest_yield_point.rs` (4 green). Banner in `turn/src/continuation.rs` rewritten LANDED + the
  receipt/atomicity boundary named precisely (yield is observation-only; commit/rollback stays whole-turn).
- THE NAMED INVARIANT (not a hole, by design): the captured mid-forest boundary is a REPRESENTATION of mid-flight
  state, NOT independently committable — a turn is all-or-nothing, so if the remaining forest would fail, the
  prefix boundary is a state the chain never commits. `midturn_split` proves only the STATE-fold half.
- CLOSURE SHAPE (the forward lane): wire the live yield into the partial-turn/promise EFFECT vocabulary
  (project-partial-turn-promises) — a `yield_point` that RETURNS a `Continuation` to a promise pipe (CapTP),
  resumed when the dependency lands, so promise pipelining inherits light-client unfoolability. The state half is
  proven; the lift is WIRE (ConditionalBatch ↔ the live yield), not new foundation.

## Touch UI (graphideOS shape) LANDED as a bake; the live-on-Android frame is the named follow-up (2026-06-25)
The touch-adapted deos UI shipped: `starbridge-v2/src/touch.rs` (`TouchShell`) — the bottom-bar five-mode
switch (Inhabit/Author/Dev/Inspect/Operate via gpui-component `TabBar`), the tappable cell garden (reusing
`wonder::WonderRoom` over the live `World`), and long-press → a bottom face-sheet (the reflected `Inspectable`
faces + the lit ACTUATE affordance firing a real `wonder::DragValue` predict-then-commit turn). Distinct from
the desktop cockpit; reuses the gpui-free view model. Baked headless via `--render-touch` (main.rs,
`render_touch_headless`; phone 390x844 default, `--render-mode <name>` selects a clean mode surface). NAMED
FOLLOW-UP (per MOBILE-DEOS.md §7 ⛔ STEP-2 wall, NOT this pass's scope): the SAME `TouchShell` painting a real
frame ON an Android device needs the gpui `PlatformAndroid` backend (window from `ANativeWindow`, an android
event/IME pump, lifecycle) — a gpui-fork change. CLOSURE SHAPE: lift upstream `gpui-mobile` + drive `TouchShell`
through it (the bake proves the element tree; the device frame waits on the backend). Also: touch gestures are
currently tap (`on_click`) + an explicit "⋯ faces" affordance standing in for long-press (gpui has no native
long-press); a real press-and-hold recognizer is the gesture-layer follow-up.

## reify_seam CLOSED at the value level; Lean uproj-injectivity is the named follow-up (2026-06-25)
`reify_cell`/`reify_ledger`/`reify_executor_state` landed (`turn/src/umem.rs`) — the byte-identical inverse of
`project_cell`/`project_ledger`, re-deriving the dropped commitments (`fields_root` from the `Field{slot≥16}`
plane; the ledger Merkle root lazily on `root()`; leaf/cap caches) rather than storing them. The round-trip law
`reify_ledger(project_ledger(L)) == L` is PROVEN over the faithful class (`turn/tests/umem_time_travel.rs`:
`reify_ledger_round_trips_a_populated_ledger`, `reify_restores_a_live_ledger_to_height_h`). HONEST RESIDUAL
(named precisely by `ReifyError` + two refusal tests `reify_refuses_heap_not_projected` /
`reify_refuses_cap_revocation_gap`): FOUR value planes `project_cell` does NOT yet carry — heap preimage
(`heap_map`; only the derived `heap_root` is projected), `Cell.interfaces`, `CapabilitySet.tombstones`, and the
post-revoke `next_slot` gap. CLOSURE SHAPE: extend the projection address space (`UKey`) with heap/interface/
tombstone planes (Rust + the Lean `UniversalBridge.UKey` twin + circuit domain codes, in lockstep), which makes
the faithful class total. NAMED LEAN FOLLOW-UP: `uproj` injectivity over the account-membership-gated class
(`metatheory/Dregg2/Exec/UniversalBridge.lean`) — the abstract reify witness (the projection determines the
state). It is a real multi-plane `funext`+codec-injectivity proof (the Lean kernel projects all 17 fields, so it
has NO heap/interface/tombstone gap — only the `accounts`-gating mirrors the Rust faithful-class restriction);
deferred rather than faked to keep `#assert_axioms`-clean. Not vacuous: the Rust round-trip is the deployed-system
guarantee and is green.

## ⚑ IVC mixed-root #1 — SAME-ENDPOINT digest: BUILT but BLOCKED on an in-circuit-Poseidon↔FRI-PoW conflict (2026-06-25)
Named by codex re-review #3 (`metatheory/docs/CODEX-IVC-REVIEW-3.md`). The distinct-endpoint mixed-root is
already structurally closed (the segment tooth binds genesis/final/count to the real descriptor leaves); the
residual is the SAME-genesis/final/count case, where the ordered-history `acc` was a one-felt QUADRATIC fold
`a*M1+b*M2+a*b*M3` — algebraically collidable (a directly-solvable colliding partner + degeneracy roots).
BUILT (`circuit-prove/src/ivc_turn_chain.rs`): `seg_hash2_in_circuit` → `seg_poseidon_commit`, a genuine
`SEG_DIGEST_WIDTH=4`-felt Poseidon2 duplex SPONGE + its host dual `seg_poseidon_commit_host`; carried
`chain_digest` widened to `[BabyBear;4]` (struct + `WholeChainProofBytes` envelope→v2 + consumers: lightclient
`AttestedHistory`, wasm views, pg-dregg transport `[[u8;32];4]` — all compile); codex #5 `num_turns < p` bound
added. **BLOCKER (empirically isolated, NOT yet fixed):** building the digest's in-circuit Poseidon2 perm via
the recursion `add_poseidon2_perm_for_challenger` (BABY_BEAR_D4_W16 — the SAME op the FRI challenger uses) makes
the real recursion fold PANIC at witness-gen: `WitnessConflict { WitnessId(0), existing [0,0,0,0], new <nonzero> }`

The live log confirms the exact issue: the segment tooth closes distinct endpoints, while the current same-endpoint residual is about the ordered `acc` binding. I’m narrowing now to the Lean theorem names and the IVC segment code/docs so the induction matches what exists rather than inventing new vocabulary.
exec
/bin/zsh -lc "sed -n '240,360p' HORIZONLOG.md" in /Users/ember/dev/breadstuffs
 succeeded in 0ms:
the real recursion fold PANIC at witness-gen: `WitnessConflict { WitnessId(0), existing [0,0,0,0], new <nonzero> }`
in `run_aggregation_verification_circuit`, originating at the FRI verifier's `check_pow_witness` `assert_zero(bit)`.
PROVEN cause (isolation runs, ~80s each): the EXACT original quadratic fold (no perm) PASSES `mixed_root` (is_err,
forgery rejected); ANY Poseidon perm (W=1 or W=4) FAILS with the conflict; the bare sponge gadget passes
standalone. ROOT (cross-agent diagnosis): a circuit-GLOBAL connect-DSU collapse — exposed segment endpoints +
a challenger recompose output get unioned into `ExprId::ZERO`'s witness class (`WitnessId(0)`); the extra perm
rows reshape the graph so a genuinely-NONZERO value lands in that class and clobbers W0 at runtime. The first
"WitnessId(0) hazard via `decompose_ext_to_base_coeffs`" the task warned of was a RED HERRING (sidestepped by
ext-perm), but a DEEPER same-class collapse via `check_pow_witness`/recompose remains.
FIX IN PROGRESS (background agent `a7b40cb5d272fe949`): ISOLATE the digest onto a SEPARATE Poseidon2 op-type
(`BABY_BEAR_D4_W24` — distinct `NpoTypeId`/variant_name ⇒ isolated chain-state + per-op CTL) so it doesn't share
the FRI challenger's W16 machinery. RISK flagged: the connect-DSU is circuit-global (not per-op), so op-type
isolation may NOT change the collapse — agent to validate at `runner.run` BEFORE full W24 table-plumbing; if W24
doesn't help, pivot to the fork DSU root-fix (forbid a created/exposed NONZERO value from slot-aliasing into
`ExprId::ZERO`; emit an equality CONSTRAINT instead — generalize fork commit `72ffc56`). Two fork-side attempts
already tried + reverted (Add-executor verify-don't-clobber [sound but only moved the clobber]; NPO-output
relocation [write-side only, insufficient]). DO NOT revert to the weak quadratic fold — making Poseidon work IS
the task. NAMED RESIDUALS (by design): online accumulator scoped OUT (codex #4, single-felt binding leaf zero-
padded); ~124-bit (4 lanes) floor liftable to 8.
STATE: fork CLEAN @8d42900; dregg digest code BUILDS but the real folds (`mixed_root`, `k_fold`) FAIL until the
perm-isolation fix lands. Cheap ivc teeth 4/4; consumers compile.

## ⚑ FULL ZED AS THE DEFAULT DEV EDITOR — ONE native `links="sqlite3"` clash left (2026-06-24)
Named by the feature-collapse + zed-full-default lane (`starbridge-v2/Cargo.toml` feature table;
`deos-zed-full/Cargo.toml`; root `Cargo.toml` exclude; `dregg-tui/`). The cockpit's Dev editor is still
deos-zed's THIN integration, not the full Zed (`deos-zed-full`'s `ZedFullPane`, written + ready in
`starbridge-v2/src/zed_full_pane.rs`).
BLOCKER 2 (root-workspace `unicode-width` VERSION conflict) — **RESOLVED** (option b). `deos-zed-full` →
editor → markdown → merman needs `unicode-width ^0.2.2`, but the former root member `dregg-tui` → `ratatui
0.29` pinned `unicode-width =0.2.0` (exact). FIX: `dregg-tui` (the ONLY ratatui user) is now its OWN
root-EXCLUDED workspace — root `Cargo.toml` `exclude` += `dregg-tui`; `dregg-tui/Cargo.toml` carries its own
`[workspace]` + `[patch.crates-io]` (ark-serialize fork) + `dregg-tui/rust-toolchain.toml` (rolling nightly),
exactly the `discord-bot`/`deos-zed-full` root-exclusion pattern. Its path-deps (sdk/turn/circuit/verifier)
stay root members so their `workspace = true` deps resolve against root. Verified: root `cargo metadata`
(full deps) green; `dregg-tui` resolves + compiles standalone (`cd dregg-tui && cargo build` — its leaf deps
green; full build only hits the PRE-EXISTING root-wide `dregg-circuit-prove` `enable_expose_claim` breakage,
another lane's in-flight API change, identical from root, NOT this lane's).
BLOCKER 1 (native `links="sqlite3"` clash) — **STILL OPEN** (the prior "in-memory store RESOLVED it" note was
INCOMPLETE). Zed's `sqlez` links `libsqlite3-sys 0.30`. The root member `deos-matrix` (pulled into the cockpit
via `dev-surfaces`) cannot share a binary with it: cargo's links-UNIFIER pulls `matrix-sdk-sqlite` →
`libsqlite3-sys 0.35` whenever `sqlez` is co-present — EVEN with `deos-matrix`'s on-disk `live-matrix` store
OFF (measured: `cargo generate-lockfile` on `deos-zed-full[full-zed]` + `deos-matrix[cockpit-surface]` fails
the links check). The default `desktop`'s `web-shell` libservo lane (→ `servo` → `servo-storage` → `rusqlite
0.37` → `libsqlite3-sys 0.35`) is the SAME clash a second way. Two `links="sqlite3"` packages in one binary
is forbidden, so merely DECLARING the optional `deos-zed-full` dep on the root member `starbridge-v2`
re-breaks WHOLE-workspace resolution (the same "declaring breaks it" class the unicode-width pin used to
cause) — the dep + `zed-full`/`zed-full-pane`/`desktop-zed-full` features stay UNDECLARED (re-add block in
`starbridge-v2/Cargo.toml`). MEASURED-CLEAN in isolation: `deos-zed-full[full-zed]` + `servo`(swgl, no
libservo) resolves green — only the `sqlez`↔`{matrix-sdk-sqlite, servo-storage}` `libsqlite3-sys` split gates
it. CLOSURE — **VALIDATED, one line**: bump Zed's `sqlez` `libsqlite3-sys` pin from `0.30.1` → `0.35.0` in the
emberian/zed fork's workspace `Cargo.toml` (line ~620). PROVEN this session via a full-source `[patch.
"https://github.com/emberian/zed"]` to a local checkout with the bump: `deos-zed-full[full-zed]` +
`servo-render[libservo]` then RESOLVE TOGETHER on ONE `libsqlite3-sys 0.35` (`sqlez` + `servo-storage` both
present, exactly one libsqlite3-sys node) AND `sqlez` COMPILES unchanged against 0.35 (sqlite3 C ABI
0.30→0.35 is backward-compatible — no source edits beyond the pin). SHIP: commit the pin bump to emberian/zed
as a new rev + bump `rev = "54fbcb6943"` → new rev across breadstuffs (`grep -rl 54fbcb6943 --include=Cargo.toml`).
THEN uncomment the re-add block (`starbridge-v2/Cargo.toml`), wire `ZedFullPane` into `open_editor_pane`
(gated `zed-full-pane`) + build the live-cockpit `AppState` (the named mount seam in `zed_full_pane.rs` —
real `client::Client`/`session::Session`/`UserStore`/`WorkspaceStore`/`LanguageRegistry`/`NodeRuntime`,
`set_global`'d), fold `zed-full` into `desktop`, retire `desktop-zed-full`, and bake Dev showing the full Zed.
(BLOCKER 2 unicode-width already CLOSED — `dregg-tui` extracted, commit `678d47ced`.)
UPDATE 2026-06-24 (`9f339c98b`): the live-cockpit `AppState` MOUNT SEAM is CLOSED. `deos_zed_full::boot::
build_live_app_state` builds a genuine non-test `workspace::AppState` (real `Client` over `RealSystemClock`
+ `HttpClientWithUrl`/`BlockedHttpClient`; `Session` over the real `db::AppDatabase` — `ZED_STATELESS` →
in-mem fallback; real `LanguageRegistry`/`UserStore`/`WorkspaceStore`; `NodeRuntime::unavailable`) +
`AppState::set_global`. starbridge-v2 gets the WINDOW-ABLE API `ZedWindow::open(id, root, files, window, cx)
-> ZedWindowHandle{pane: ZedFullPane (CockpitSurface), project}` — each call an independent Zed window (own
Workspace + own FirmamentZedFs ledger), so the desktop hosts ONE or MANY. VERIFIED: `deos-zed-full[full-zed]`
green + new bake `tests/live_app_state_workspace_png_bake.rs` PASSES (a REAL Zed Workspace from the PRODUCTION
AppState renders the file tree proj/{src,lib.rs,main.rs} + an open editor over a cell, 3600x2200 PNG).
REMAINING SEAM (UNCHANGED, fork-gated): the `deos-zed-full` dep + `zed-full`/`zed-full-pane` features stay
COMMENTED in `starbridge-v2/Cargo.toml` — merely declaring the dep re-injects `sqlez → libsqlite3-sys 0.30`
into the ROOT lock graph, clashing (`links=sqlite3`) with `deos-matrix → libsqlite3-sys 0.35` (EMPIRICALLY
re-confirmed this session: `cargo generate-lockfile` fails the links check at rev `54fbcb6943`). The ONE-LINE
close is still pending: bump the emberian/zed fork's `sqlez` pin `0.30.1 → 0.35.0` + repin the rev across
breadstuffs, THEN uncomment. (The cockpit-side code is DONE — only the fork-rev/repin step remains; it is
fenced off as "don't touch the gpui fork" for this lane.)

## ✎ "MAKE YOUR FIRST CARD" — repeat entry from Author mode (2026-06-24)
Named by the onboarding commit (`12d072eff`; `starbridge-v2/src/dock/card_surface.rs::build_first_card_surface`,
`cockpit/frame.rs::{make_first_card, first_card_view, first_card_invite}`, the `--render-first-card` bake). The
"make your first card →" invite + the dedicated first-card view (mint → +1 a real turn → two receipted edit
affordances → re-render, all PROVEN by the bake: home-cell slot-0 0→1, card tape = 1 receipt, the added button in
the card's view_source, the before/after frames differ) close the FIRST-card gap on the Inhabit landing. CLOSURE
(small): the invite is first-run-only — a returning user who wants ANOTHER fresh card has no repeat entry (the
card stays minted + findable, and Author mode holds the card-editor, but there is no "+ new card" affordance from
within the full frame). Lane: surface a "+ new card" in Author mode reusing `build_first_card_surface` (the mint is
already a clean function; this is a button + a mount, not new machinery).

## ⚑ LIVE BRAIN DECIDES THE `deos.compose` STORY — the compose seam (2026-06-24)
Named by the bounded multi-cell compose commit (`deos-hermes/tests/hermes_composes_multi_cell.rs`,
`deos-hermes/src/live_js.rs::LiveComposeHands`). The confined agent can now decide-and-execute a genuinely
useful, BOUNDED, MULTI-CELL task through `run_js` — `deos.compose([...])` mints a card + seeds it + grants a
peer a cap as ONE all-or-nothing receipted gesture on the live World, refused in-band (nothing committed) on
over-reach (`held`/scope/grant-width). PROVEN end-to-end: the direct tool AND a real `AcpClient` session with a
scripted-brain stand-in (`MockHermesPeer`) emitting the compose JS as a `run_js` body → `LiveComposeHands` hook
→ `run_compose` → bounded story on the live ledger (3 receipts, the collaborator holds the cap). The ONE open
seam (identical to the authoring seam `live_authors_card_via_run_js`): a REAL `hermes-acp` brain reliably
emitting WELL-FORMED `deos.compose([...])` JSON as its `run_js` body (provider-gated; the scripted stand-in
proves the run_js→compose PATH, a live decide needs the model to cooperate). CLOSURE: an `#[ignore]` live test
mirroring `live_authors_card_via_run_js` (drive the subprocess with a "stand up a shared notebook" prompt + a
compose-API system hint), flipped on when a `hermes-acp` install + reachable provider is present.

## ⚑ WASM EXECUTOR WALL CLOCK — a real turn panics on wasm32 (`Instant::now`) (2026-06-24)
Named by the deos-card seam-closing commit (`d16b0af32`, `wasm/tests/card_fires_a_verified_turn.rs`). The
in-tab verified executor is drivable for everything EXCEPT a real turn: `turn/src/executor/{execute,
execute_tree}.rs` take unconditional `std::time::Instant::now()` profiling fences (`_pt*`/`_pf_*`, used only
under `DREGG_TURN_PROFILE`), and std's `wasm32-unknown-unknown` `Instant` is unbacked — it PANICS ("time not
implemented on this platform"), NOT routed through `performance.now()`, so the real browser playground hits
it on any `execute_turn` too (no existing wasm test fired a turn, which is why it was unsurfaced). The card
loop (`CardWorld::fire` → SetField+IncrementNonce → verified turn → re-read bound slot) is PROVEN on the host
target; the wasm32 smoke proves CardWorld instantiates + reads in a real module. CLOSURE: give `turn/` a wasm
clock — `web-time` gated on `target_arch="wasm32"`, or move the `_pt*`/`_pf_*` fences behind
`cfg(not(target_arch="wasm32"))` (they are measurement-only). Then the wasm32 `fire` test (+ the unknown-
affordance refusal) flips on and the in-tab card fires real turns end-to-end.

## ✅ REVOKE-DELEGATION EPOCH STEP — FORCED at the abstract descriptor (the last per-effect epoch residual closed) (2026-06-24)
The `RevokeDelegationEpochResidual` (parent epoch `+1`, child snapshot cleared, child stamp reset) is no
longer a carried fail-closed conjunct in any per-effect bridge. NEW dedicated DUAL descriptor
`Dregg2/Circuit/Inst/revokeDelegationFullA.lean` (`revokeDelegationFullE`): `active1 = caps` removeEdge,

metatheory/docs/CODEX-IVC-REVIEW-3.md:1:# Codex re-review #3 — the segment-accumulator close + the weak-digest deviation (2026-06-24)
metatheory/docs/CODEX-IVC-REVIEW-3.md:3:VERDICT: PARTIAL CLOSE. Distinct-endpoint mixed-root forgery genuinely REJECTED (structural). But the digest deviation (base-field fold instead of codex's specified collision-resistant commitment) is a REAL soundness downgrade for same-endpoint/same-count histories — and it's ALGEBRAICALLY broken, not merely 31-bit.
metatheory/docs/CODEX-IVC-REVIEW-3.md:5:**Verdict: partial close.** The original mixed-root forgery with different genesis/final/count is closed in the K-fold path. The root proof exposes the descriptor-derived segment, and the verifier compares it to the carried claim at [ivc_turn_chain.rs:1757](/Users/ember/dev/breadstuffs/circuit-prove/src/ivc_turn_chain.rs:1757). So if A and B differ in genesis, final, or count, the rejection does not depend on the digest.

Aggregation exposes only `[first_old, last_new, count, acc]` at [ivc_turn_chain.rs:1632](/Users/ember/dev/breadstuffs/circuit-prove/src/ivc_turn_chain.rs:1632).

metatheory/docs/CODEX-IVC-REVIEW-3.md:27:**Bottom line:** distinct-endpoint mixed-root forgery is genuinely rejected. Full ordered-history soundness is not achieved. Same-endpoint/same-count histories rely on a one-felt, algebraically weak digest; if an attacker can realize colliding intermediate roots as valid executions, a proof of A can stand in for B’s middle history. The fix should replace `seg_hash2_*` with an in-circuit collision-resistant multi-felt commitment, and the root claim should carry that wider digest.

# dregg memory index — one line per memory; open the topic file for the detail.
# ⚑ ORIENT FROM THIS RECORD, not the compaction summary (see feedback-orient-from-the-record):
#   REORIENT.md → HORIZONLOG.md → this index WHOLE → flagged (⚑) topic files → docs + captured artifacts.
#   Read the record for the SHAPE; verify code vs HEAD for the STATE (memories are dated/point-in-time).
# ⚑ GROUNDED WHAT-IS: `docs/reference/` (committed, grounded to file:line at HEAD) is the source-of-truth
#   for what each subsystem IS + the Lean theorems backing it. When a memory and docs/reference disagree,
#   the doc wins. Start: docs/OVERVIEW.md → docs/reference/README.md (lean-circuit/lean-assurance/lean-authority/turns/...).
# The one-sentence through-line: macaroons/biscuits → biscuit's Datalog became the derivation circuit →
#   "a turn is the exercise of an attenuable proof-carrying token over owned state, leaving a verifiable receipt."

## ⚑ CURRENT — the live state + vision (read these first)
- [⚑⚑⚑ umem-as-a-Primitive Epoch](project-umem-as-primitive-epoch.md) — 2026-06-24/25: universal memory became a sovereign portable WITNESSED primitive (per-cell heaps · working mem · passable intermediate states · composable). The KEYSTONE (boundary→committed-state + the cross-cell-read, `99a8dc94`) + per-cell/whole-image/OFE proofs all `#assert_axioms`-clean (`f0372f22`/`bf200960`/`bee42d4a`); 6 revolutions prototyped (agent-memory, membrane, continuations, checkpointable-runtime, time-travel, proof-shrink); PQ-plausible; Codex cross-reviewed. Open tails named. `docs/deos/UMEM-*.md`.
- [⚑⚑⚑ Cells-as-Service + Boolean-Matching](project-cells-as-service-boolean-matching.md) — 2026-06-25: service-objects belong ABOVE the effectvm (NOT a kernel effect — `Effect::Invoke` killed, S1 v9→v10 commitment BACKED OUT; invoke desugars at the SDK/app layer). Re-ground dregg's 4+ scattered boolean-matching surfaces on a boolean-closed DERIVATIVE algebra à la RE#/ERE≤ (Lean-formalized, free-use) — prove over OUR `Pred` (= the EBA shape), ERE≤ a blueprint. `dregg-dfa` = the verified dispatch primitive. `docs/deos/{DERIVATIVE-MATCHING-DESIGN,BOOLEAN-MATCHING-REGROUND,…}.md`.
- [⚑⚑⚑ graphideOS + Android Epoch](project-graphideos-android-epoch.md) — 2026-06-24/25: deos reaches android BOTH ways — android-cell (foreign app cap-bounded + interactive, live on the emulator via HVF, reuses servo's compositor) + graphideOS (deos AS android = a GrapheneOS-fork ALTERVERSE; the verified core RUNS on android, the gpui PlatformAndroid renderer initializes on-device, painted-frame needs real arm64 hw). One gpui workspace-wide (`0ef7ba84`/`498321a4`).
- [⚑⚑ Be Thoughtful, Not Trigger-Happy](feedback-be-thoughtful-not-trigger-happy.md) — from thin/rolled context do NOT fire kernel/effect/commitment changes (the `Effect::Invoke`/custom-AIR scar); service-matching above the effectvm; "keep developing" = the app layer (gpui-component, not raw gpui) in PARALLEL while circuit/soundness gets THOUGHT.
- [⚑⚑⚑ Hyperdreggmedia + Agent-in-deos Epoch](project-hyperdreggmedia-agent-in-deos-epoch.md) — 2026-06-23: the agent INHABITS the live cockpit (run_js drives the real World; a live Copilot Claude decided JS + drove it, receipted + confined) + HYPERDREGGMEDIA authoring opened (the card-editor KEYSTONE landed — edit a card from within as receipted patches, agent authors a card's UI). dregg-as-host DECIDED (jail hermes, no fork). Frame: Rust cockpit = the dev-VM basement; the world arises fully inside dregg, renderer-independent. Release cut (292M), pop-out crash hardened. **06-24:** authoring epoch FANNED OUT (8 surfaces + `HYPERDREGGMEDIA.md` charter `72cddf9c`); workspace UNIFIED (12 elephants→root, one target, ~271G reclaimed, `4d19f7cb`) + forks GIT-ified (zed/gpui-component/stylo on GitHub → buildable by anyone + CI fixed, `47cff3190`); MUD reframed (GM-as-privileged-server, richness not fog-of-war). ⚑ LIVE FRONTIER = the **FULLY-REFLECTIVE COCKPIT** (convert its surfaces to deos-js cards so the agent reflects-on+rewrites the REAL cockpit — the counter demo `a326b3215` was only the loop-proof).
- [⚑⚑⚑ Perf+Kernel+Supply Epoch](project-perf-kernel-supply-epoch.md) — 2026-06-23: per-turn commitment made cheap — the full-65k-leaf rebuild-every-recompute was the bomb; no-copy `lean_object*` FFI + sparse Merkle + field-`%` + cap-root cache + incremental commitment, all byte-identical (the "~370ms→~2.85µs / ~130,000×" headline is a DATED profiler-comment note, not a committed benchmark — `turn/.../turn_profile.rs:5`; treat the exact µs/× as approximate-unverified); the Rust↔Lean kernel equivalence AUDITED (state-agreement ≠ rejection-parity → built `rejection_parity.rs`) + 6 Rust under-enforcements aligned to the verified spec (self-transfer, 9 lifecycle-liveness arms, archive, …); and a coherent per-asset-well SUPPLY MODEL (`docs/SUPPLY-MODEL.md`: cap-gated Mint/Burn) — Stages 1+2 SHIPPED (first-class provable `Effect::Mint` w/ dedicated `sel::MINT` circuit selector). Also: the "~17 fixes" circuit memory was STALE (now a proven-class taxonomy).
- [⚑⚑⚑ deos Self-Hosting Epoch SHIPPED](project-deos-self-hosting-epoch.md) — 2026-06-22: the desktop epoch is BUILT + GREEN. Editor+terminal as cockpit DOCK PANES (⌘K → real PTY/editor split), document language (dregg-doc patch core + editor-as-document + conflict-viewer), dregg-pilled Matrix chat (the MEMBRANE star: a message = a cap-bounded world-fork you drive+stitch), confined Hermes (ACP↔ToolGateway), gpui-component cockpit overhaul, atlas refreshed (31 surfaces incl. offscreen app bakes). All tested. METHODS minted: file-partitioned swarm + main-loop seam-resolution; offscreen-capture-for-atlas; gpui-component Theme-init-on-every-App.
- [⚑⚑ Refinement Epoch](project-refinement-epoch.md) — THE MODE: the dregg3 substrate epoch CLOSED; now REFINE — usability/teaching/the "lamesauce" predicate-caveat LANGUAGE uplift/not-a-toy apps/green-down-the-board. Wide seat of wonder; don't scope down.
- [⚑⚑ dregg3 Campaign](project-dregg3-campaign.md) — the kernel REDESIGN: 6 nouns, **8 verbs** (a DESIGN ABSTRACTION + its `minimality` theorem over `Substrate/VerbRegistry.lean`, NOT the deployed count — `turn/src/action.rs::Effect` is 32 variants / ~36-way tag at HEAD), 6 unifications (one Pred algebra · sorted-Poseidon2 everywhere · AssetId:=issuer-cell Σδ=0 · one executor · one circuit · one codec). The constructive-knowledge correction (authority = PRODUCTION under non-forgeability, NOT affine descent — the §3 error I must never repeat). The Metatheory/* trunk. Product ladder (dregg-auth = the gateway; adoption IS attenuation).
- [⚑⚑ deos UX Vision](project-deos-ux-vision.md) — THE desktop north star: 1999-AOL-4-year-old WONDER (click around, absorb, no comprehension needed) FUSED with Pharo/Smalltalk LIVENESS (the image IS its own IDE/inspector/debugger, malleable from within). starbridge-v2 = the desktop; needs a big overhaul to reach it. site/studio was v1. Test: would a 5-year-old click it with delight AND can an adept inspect/modify it live?
- [⚑⚑ deos Desktop Frontier](project-deos-desktop-frontier.md) — the live desktop NOW: the LIVE IMAGE VIEWER boots on seL4 (`make run-image` — a Pharo-style browser of REAL sovereign cells, four substances, BALANCE_SUM=0; commit `bbccc03ca`). **✅ THE #1 PRECIOUS IS CLOSED** (`d92d0526c`): the gpui-offscreen render reaches the seL4 framebuffer. NEW frontier = make that hosted image INTERACTIVE (input already boots; live-repaint-on-turn = copy net.system) — `docs/desktop-os-research/SEL4-INTERACTIVE-COCKPIT.md`. The desktop UX build now lives in [[moldable-inspector-epoch]].
- [⚑⚑ Moldable Inspector Epoch](project-moldable-inspector-epoch.md) — THE LIVE STARBRIDGE BUILD (2026-06-19): Pharo-moldable multiplicity of inspectors+gadgets over the COMPLETE protocol (151 types censused; `Presentable`/`Gadget`/`Spotter`/`Halo`; `docs/deos/INSPECTOR-FRAMEWORK.md`). Liveness wave shipped (inspect→act · workspace · wonder); L1 spine building; L2-L10 to fan out. Also: `docs/ARCHEOLOGY-LEDGER.md` corpus dig + `docs/desktop-os-research/SEL4-INTERACTIVE-COCKPIT.md` (input is NOT greenfield).
- [⚑⚑ Circuit-Soundness Apex](project-circuit-soundness-apex.md) — light-client unfoolability (`verifyBatch accept ⟹ ∃ genuine kernel transition`). The apex `theorem lightclient_unfoolable` (`CircuitSoundness.lean:453`) + the FIVE guarantee apexes (`unfoolability/authority/conservation/integrity/freshness_guarantee`, `AssuranceCase.lean`) + the cap-reshape crown #103 + whole-history aggregation (`light_client_verifies_whole_history`) + `only_connectivity_begets_connectivity` + `settlement_soundness` + the macaroon↔cap arrow `chainGateG_implies_capAuthorityG` (`CaveatCapBridge.lean:168`) are ALL `#assert_axioms`-clean; corpus sorry-free; the 3 epoch-stamp residuals CLOSED/SUPERSEDED. Per-effect rungs PROVEN individually (dominant label CLASS A, `ClosureAll.lean`; the VALUE_FORCED/… labels are header-only, not a clean partition). GENUINE open = a short named tail: un-assembled `∀ e, descriptorRefines` · intra-turn receipt-LOG seam (kernel half forced) · faithful-encoding crypto carriers · attenuate v3-registry cutover. ⚑ `docs/reference/` is the grounded what-is. Verify CODE vs HEAD.
- [⚑ ARGUS Vision](project-argus-vision.md) — the circuit must witness the protocol's CORRECT EVOLUTION so a light client CAN'T BE FOOLED; foil = the pale ghost. Bar = no-malleability + no-forgotten-precondition + refines. The LINCHPIN LANDED (authority/non-amp/production in-circuit via the cap-reshape crown); the apex + five guarantees are `#assert_axioms`-clean. The fidelity column (kernel-state→circuit→interpreter→turn→aggregate→light-client) is climbed: the denotational interpreter-edge differential is BUILT, the recursive whole-chain fold is LIVE, only a small named tail (receipt-LOG seam · node leg-iterate wiring · recursion-fork follow-ups) remains. The whole stack = ONE transformer algebra, ONE Lean-derived circuit/VK.
- [⚑ Firmament/seL4 BOOTS](project-firmament-sel4-boots.md) — dregg-on-seL4 (Robigalia v0) BOOTS (M0/M1/M2/M-STARK/M5, native-macOS Microkit). Firmament = ONE cap across DISTANCE (local seL4-cap ↔ distributed dregg-cap ↔ surface=window; n=1 collapse). The executor-PD Lean-runtime blocker is **REFUTED + BOOTS** (embeddable runtime measured; pg full-D = days). NEVER re-haze from a `which`/`ls` probe.
- [⚠ House Capacities — UNPROVEN/UNWIRED SKETCHES](project-house-capacities.md) — CORRECTED 2026-06-22: 8 Track-2 "capacities" are Rust `cell/src/*.rs` DESIGN SKETCHES with SMOKE TESTS (forge-detectors ≠ Lean proofs), NOT wired into the living protocol (no live Effect/circuit; only reactive is wired). To be real = the formal route in ./metatheory (Lean effect + descriptor + apex rung). The drift lesson: build capacities IN the formal setup, not the Rust periphery.
- [⚑ Coherence Census](project-coherence-census.md) — the whole-tree harsh look + docs/DREGG3.md; circuit ~11.5K live of 112K (~33K deletable); strata = a good tower ×8 not ×52.
- [⚑ Cap-Reshape Crown — LANDED](project-cap-reshape-plan.md) — the openable capability_root (depth-16 sorted-Poseidon2 Merkle) welded to the `is_attenuation` lattice → in-circuit non-amp + production-authority, the ARGUS linchpin #103, `#assert_axioms`-clean (`capReshapeVmDescriptor` + teeth). The SDK Phase-D payoff is wired (`verify_full_turn_bound` binds the cap-membership leg to the canonical root, anti-forgery teeth bite). One deployed-route residual: route `attenuate` through the recompute descriptor as its v3-registry LEAD. CLOSED, not a plan.
- [⚑ Pug Handoff Target](project-pug-handoff.md) — the stranger-usable bar: works without ember in the loop.
- [dregg Integrators + One-Seam](project-dregg-integrators-one-seam.md) — agents are intricate LOOPS; dregg closes the enforcement gap at ONE seam (the tool-call/verdict record); ADOS = substrate not a new loop.
- [⚠ dregg2 Architecture](project-dregg2-architecture.md) — DATED: `./metatheory` IS dregg2 (Lean4, l4v-shaped); but its "seed / not-yet-an-OS / rbg-not-ours-to-boot" framing is SUPERSEDED (it boots — see firmament-sel4-boots + refinement-epoch).

## ⚑ FORWARD vision
- [⚑⚑ Polisware Constitution](project-polisware-constitution.md) — the "fair playground for superintelligences" is a BUILDING kernel-clean Lean artifact: `metatheory/Metatheory/{Polis,DreggPolis,PolisNonConfusion}.lean` welds the dregg⋈svenvs⋈Lacan synthesis to the real tree (polis_safety ∀-opaque · legitimacy=non-regression · disclosure=EpistemicDial · authority=l4v Auth+camera Fpu · non-confusion+unfoolability from deployed proofs · first concrete politician bar). `~/dev/svenvs` grounds it: inhabitant is the ∀-term the proof never reasons about (shadow inert), govern trace-shape not motive, polis edge = empty meet of EXPORTED floors.
- [⚑⚑ Distributed-Houyhnhnm Frontier](project-distributed-houyhnhnm-frontier.md) — THE 2026-06-19 SYNTHESIS: dregg IS the cap-secure witnessed realization of fare's Houyhnhnm Computing (read whole; resolves the Urbit critique). Distributed time-travel = event-structure config lattice + RCCS reversibility + revocation-non-monotone-at-settlement; the **Settlement Soundness theorem** (authority-live-at-settlement) extends light-client unfoolability → lands in circuit-soundness. Branch-and-stitch protocol (consensual virtualized pasts · nesting=firmament-confinement-safety · lossy stitch w/ linear-drop, pushout-correct). PATCH THEORY = the same event-structure object in VC clothes (turn-layer already IS it); new value at the DOCUMENT LANGUAGE (Pijul-shaped, conflicts-as-objects) + the stitch. Docs: `docs/deos/{DISTRIBUTED-TIMETRAVEL-SEMANTICS,BRANCH-AND-STITCH-PROTOCOL,DOCUMENT-LANGUAGE,IMPLEMENTATION-ROADMAP}.md`.
- [⚑ Partial-Turn / Promises](project-partial-turn-promises.md) — ember's idea: an effect that WITNESSES/EMITS a partial turn with holes/promises, braiding CapTP promise pipelining DOWN into the circuit/effect layer. THE INSIGHT: a promise-hole IS a nullifier; resolution = a spend; one-shot linearity = the double-spend non-membership the circuit ALREADY enforces (noteSpend grow-gate). ⚑ CENSUS 2026-06-19 (a504ad88): NOT just pieces — LARGELY BUILT + PROVEN. ConditionalBatch+EventualRef+Slots (Kahn topo, atomic: `condTurn_atomic/conserves/dependency_sound`), the Await algebra (one-shot continuations: `commit_resumes_once`, `four_faces_unify`), GUARDED HOLES (`holeFill_binds_in_circuit` — a fill binds δ AND guard, lazy-witness/eager-shape, fail-closed — the genuinely-new keystone), CapTP pipelining (`drainAll_preserves_caps/_head_authorized`, `overAuthorized_send_rejected`). Rust: turn/src/{eventual,conditional,pending}.rs + captp/src/pipeline.rs. THE GAP IS ARCHITECTURAL not foundational: lift ConditionalBatch into the first-class EFFECT vocabulary + the circuit/light-client semantics of a batch-bearing effect (read execConditionalTurn + FullForest + apex fold). Move = WIRE, not build. STRONG guarded hole (undetermined-δ) is INEXPRESSIBLE = safe-by-inexpressibility (dregg's load-bearing line). Payoff: promise pipelining gets light-client-unfoolability.
- [dregg4 Vision](project-dregg4-vision.md) — turn = guarded comodel/lens; attestation dial-cube; the SINGLE-MACHINE PRINCIPLE (n=1 collapses distributed bounds to strong-local — consistent checkpoint/sync commit/immediate revocation); hypersystem/simplicial joint turns (tensor non-finality = the price).
- [Adjunction Thesis Verdict](project-adjunction-thesis-verdict.md) — Lawvere hyperdoctrine (Predicate⊣Witness base + graded ∃⊣q*⊣∀; agreement=limit; adjudication=a separate graded reflector); the REFUTED adjoint thesis; novel theorem (reflector-failure ≅ dual-H¹ Byzantine non-gluing).
- [Flow-Algebra Right-Skew](project-flow-algebra-right-skew.md) — dregg's workflow/flow composition is PROVEN right-skewed (RSKA_d⊓, Pradic 2408.14999): choice ⊔ does NOT left-distribute over compose ⋆ — the algebraic shadow of the reactive rung (online sim, not trace language); payoff = DECIDABLE flow/policy refinement via the Büchi game (the ARGUS "refines" bar).
- [Silver/Golden Visions](project-silver-and-golden-visions.md) — Silver (integration-complete) precedes Golden (full algebraic / folded-DAG). · [Midnight Strategy](project-midnight-strategy.md) — Midnight/Cardano interop; ZKIR v3 backend; observation-bridge.
- [Rhizomatic↔dregg Slotting](project-rhizomatic-dregg-slotting.md) — `~/dev/rhizomatic` (separate repo: Merkle-CRDT/G-Set portable data format) IS dregg's I-confluent fragment taken globally; they diverge on exactly ONE axis = conservation; slots in as dregg's read/query face (L2–L5) for the monotone substrate + the unbuilt `merge` interpretation (DREGG3 §2.4).

## ⚑ METHOD — how to work here (feedback)
- [⚑⚑ A Named Seam Is NOT A Hole](feedback-named-seam-is-not-a-hole.md) — 2026-06-24: what misled us into recurring OVER-pessimism — reading dregg's honest seam/residual/carrier NAMING as uniform debt. CLASSIFY each (TERMINAL-CRYPTO-FLOOR by design / REDUCIBLE-OPEN / CLOSED / CALIBRATION); measure TRACTABILITY not coverage; VERIFY-BEFORE-PESSIMISM (the dual of measure-before-claiming). Instances: "~17 fixes" stale, "∀-comp 44 tough proofs" was assembled-mod-floor, "supply decorative" load-bearing, execGraph "debt" was calibration. Corollary (43→110): don't be fooled optimistic either — genuine witnesses, no overlooking.
- [⚑⚑ Orient From The Record](feedback-orient-from-the-record.md) — orient from the durable record, NEVER the compaction summary + a shallow probe (probes LIE — the seL4-haze scar); read for SHAPE, verify code vs HEAD for STATE.
- [⚑⚑ We Do Not Name — We Ship](feedback-we-do-not-name-we-ship.md) — every caveat arrives WITH its closure lane running; "named" = a burn-down, never a parking lot.
- [⚑ Seams Are Work, Not Walls](feedback-seams-are-work-not-walls.md) — a labeled seam / out-of-band gate is a SEVERE PROBLEM not a wall; drive every divergence to ONE worthwhile semantics; terminal only = a named crypto primitive or an ember-decision.
- [⚑ Rise To Meet The Claim](feedback-rise-to-meet-the-claim.md) — overclaim found = fix the text AND open the closure lane in the same breath (caveat lifetime: hours).
- [⚑ Green Or Bust](feedback-green-or-bust-no-artifact-fallbacks.md) — never ship stale/last-good artifacts or non-fatal CI; fail loudly, fix the root.
- [⚑ Empirical Validation > Paper-Green](feedback-empirical-validation-n3.md) — the live N=3 testnet run VALIDATES whether things work; green CI is NOT its prerequisite. Run it to learn (likely cures devnet latest_height:0). Tag/publish come AFTER seeing it work.
- [⚑ Don't Launder Vacuity](feedback-dont-launder-vacuity-as-honest.md) — a labeled vacuity is still BROKEN; prove every load-bearing spec non-vacuous (true AND false).
- [⚑ Conservation ≠ Correctness](feedback-conservation-is-not-correctness.md) — conservation is a PROJECTION not soundness; the 3-corner triangle per effect (full-state eSpec ⟸ executor⟺spec + circuit⟺spec) + the anti-ghost tooth.
- [⚑ Stop Auditing — Internalize](feedback-stop-auditing-internalize-guarantees.md) — issue EMPOWERED DOERS that fix/implement; an out-of-band guarantee = failure to internalize → make the protocol ENFORCE inline.
- [⚑⚑ Don't Launder a Load-Bearing Insecurity](feedback-dont-launder-a-load-bearing-insecurity.md) — SCAR: I rationalized a 31-bit commitment as "consistent w/ the existing scheme / pre-existing audited floor" + stacked 5 trust waves on it. "Load-bearing AND everywhere" = the BUG not a defense; MEASURE the bits (31 vs 62 vs 124), MATCH the system's own soundness (FRI ~130bit → 8-felt commit, not the reserved 4), cite the doc not your assumption; a floor that sits UNDER other work comes FIRST. (Fix: `docs/FAITHFUL-STATE-COMMITMENT.md`.)
- [⚑ Braids Not Waves](feedback-braids-not-waves.md) — finish a cluster → IMMEDIATELY launch/integrate the next strand; main loop = continuous launcher+integrator (commits agent drafts by file set); proofs = subagent work.
- [⚑⚑ Swarm Shared-Tree Clobber Hazard](feedback-swarm-shared-tree-clobber-hazard.md) — all agents share ONE working tree; concurrent edits to shared manifests (Cargo.toml/lib.rs/mod.rs) CLOBBER (scar: the unification edit-war). Main loop owns ALL shared-file edits + cargo; agents draft DISJOINT new files only; shared-manifest restructures in a quiet window. NO WORKTREES (ember-banned, "harsh the vibe"). Don't be scarred by one clobber; dregg-self-host (patches/conflict-objects) is the real cure.
- [⚑ Verification Economy](feedback-verification-economy.md) — NO full-suite re-runs between turns; trust lane logs + targeted spot-checks; full gauntlet = background persvati only.
- [⚑ Cockpit Edits Need the gpui Build Check](feedback-cockpit-edits-need-the-gpui-build-check.md) — starbridge-v2 `cockpit.rs` is in `main.rs` gated `#[cfg(gpui-ui)]`, NOT the lib; the gpui-free `--lib` suite never compiles it (a `crate::` vs `starbridge_v2::` break shipped green ×4). After ANY cockpit/gpui edit: `cargo check --features native-full --bin starbridge-v2`.
- [⚑ HORIZONLOG Standing Practice](feedback-horizonlog-standing-practice.md) — every named follow-up enters git-tracked HORIZONLOG in the same breath; reports/commits aren't durable.
- [⚑⚑ Don't Over-Ember-Gate](feedback-dont-over-ember-gate.md) — drive ALL artifact work (incl. VK-affecting) to green + commit without asking; don't label work "ember-gated". (The redeploy half is now MOOT — the devnet is GONE as of 2026-06-22; see the DEVNET line below.)
- [⚑ Docs Teach What-Is](feedback-docs-teach-what-is.md) — present tense, first principles; NEVER trajectory-narrativize (minimality = a property, history = git).
- [⚑ Sober Demonstrative Register](feedback-sober-demonstrative-register.md) — outward material = what-it-is / play-with-it / what-it-does / what-it-enables for sober programmers; NO pride/boast/scoreboard-vs-prior-art ("Xanadu that shipped" was TOXIC). Broader site sweep owed.
- [⚑ One Executor Entry · Rust is Buggy](feedback-one-executor-entry-real-tests-rust-is-buggy.md) — Rust `turn/` = the BUGGY thing dregg2 replaces, never an oracle; ONE gated entry + ONE @[export]; `#guard` not `#eval`; .md can be stale, read CODE.
- [⚑ No Phantom Commits / Metatheory IS the Jam](feedback-no-phantom-commits-metatheory-is-the-jam.md) — VERIFY THE REFLOG (agents draft-and-return, main loop commits); don't ship the easy 60% + defer the hard core.
- [⚑ Never git-checkout / Don't Dismiss a Stuck Proof](feedback-never-git-checkout-never-dismiss-stuck-proof.md) — WIP-commit not revert; a stuck proof may be a REAL BUG; step back + split, don't thrash.

## MINTED — capabilities earned (write here as eagerly as to scars; each carries a witness)
- [⚑ Perf-Sin Sweep + Verify-Before-Optimism](minted-perf-sin-sweep.md) — 2026-06-24: the system-wide perf-debt sweep as a velocity swarm (hunt→fix the mechanical sins: Vec-as-set→HashSet, clone→borrow, recompute→cache; result-identity-gated, one build at the end). The discipline: dont manufacture sins, LEAVE load-bearing clones (tamper-witness re-folds, API-required moves), STOP-REPORT the risky. Traps: the gpui-build feature trap, the reseal-once soundness-delicacy (NOT a velocity fix), the API throttle + SendMessage-resume. Commits 800214b7a→449a61f04.
- [⚑⚑ Proof-Integrity Discipline + MEASURE-Don't-Claim](minted-proof-integrity-discipline.md) — 2026-06-24: the "decorative proofs" alarm (mine, twice-overstated) was EMPIRICALLY REFUTED — mutation canary (`scripts/mutation-canary.sh`) + `@[load_bearing]` linter (`Dregg2/Verify/LoadBearingLint.lean`: import-boundary + `isDefEq spec gate` + non-vacuity, LIVE in CI) measured 55/60+ specs GENUINE; the ONE real gate-copy (`execGraph` defeq, reaching the C-c1 `deployed_system_secure` guarantee) was found + FIXED (independent `authConnects` + genuine refinement, `61ff2306c`); both residuals closed (`3ff827b4c`/`784894bff`); `ForestLTS` collateral fixed (`0603392d5`); `deployed_no_replay` banked (`0f87f8449`). NEVER call a proof load-bearing/decorative without the structural+mutation test.
- [⚑ Handler-Floors Retire the Gate-Hole Class](minted-handler-floors-retire-gate-hole-class.md) — the proof-carrying `FloorObligation` pattern: a forgotten gate becomes a TYPE ERROR (w: handler-floors P0–P4 `b9a70cecc`→`e649e89bb`, 6/6 floors, the structural answer to the 2026-06-23 review-cycle whack-a-mole; forest inherits for free).
- [⚑ House via the Factory Route](minted-house-via-factory-route.md) — the house capacities weld as PROVEN factory-born cells (vault `0cb50239` + allowance `3f544330` SHIPPED), NOT new Effects; corrects project-house-capacities' 'needs a new verb' prescription (heavier than reality — a vault is a COMPOSITION).
- THE WELD METHOD: census first — the capability usually already EXISTS, disconnected; welding beats building (w: ORGANS.md, the three organ welds).
- MEASURE BEFORE BELIEVING A LEVER (w: #174, `0b05afc1a`) · THE MODEL-FINDS-THE-BUG LOOP (w: QueueRoot→hardening) · STAGED-ADDITIVE-THEN-CUTOVER (w: IR-v2, the rotation train, PATH-PRESERVE) · THE LANE-FINISHER PATTERN · ONE-CORRELATING-OBSERVABLE (`4173d6103`) · TWO-GATES-PROVABLY-AGREE (`7da845758`) · CONVERGENCE ROUNDS catch what narrow verification can't (`55318b702`).
- ⚑ VERIFY-BEFORE-ASSERTING REFUTES BANKED PREMISES: a measured spike overturned the "mimalloc-override + worker-threads block embedding" premise BOTH frontiers leaned on — the executor PD already boots; pg full-D = days (w: the embeddable-runtime spike `c93293686`, `docs/EMBEDDABLE-LEAN-RUNTIME.md`).

## REFERENCE (operational)

The repo has both the abstract Lean whole-history model and the newer Rust segment accumulator comments. I’m reading those two surfaces side by side: `RecursiveAggregation.lean` gives the current `EngineSound` shape, and `ivc_turn_chain.rs` documents the segment construction that the new Lean theorem should model.

# Dregg2.Circuit.RecursiveAggregation — RECURSIVE-AGGREGATION SOUNDNESS (magnesium → gold).

**The headline.** A light client that verifies ONE succinct aggregate proof — and re-witnesses
NOTHING of the history — learns that the WHOLE chain of N finalized turns is correct:
every turn executed correctly per the verified executor, the chain is correctly ordered (no
reorder/drop/insert), and the final root is the genuine fold of the whole history. This is the model
that the IVC accumulator (`circuit/src/ivc_turn_chain.rs::prove_turn_chain_recursive` →
`WholeChainProof`) realizes; `verify_turn_chain_recursive` checks only the root, cost independent of N.

**Why proofs are ADDITIVE ATTESTATION here, and that is the POINT.** The light client does NOT
re-execute the history, does NOT re-hash the states, does NOT walk the blocklace. It checks the
succinct aggregate. The aggregate's validity, UNDER the named soundness hypotheses below, IS exactly
`HistoryAggregation.WellFormedChain` (`aggregate_attests_whole_history`) — so trusting the aggregate
is trusting the whole history. The verification IS the trust.

**What is PROVED vs. what is a NAMED, REALIZABLE hypothesis (the boundary).** You cannot prove
plonky3/pickles FRI-recursion soundness in Lean — it is the soundness of a concrete Rust prover over
a concrete field. So we NAME the three soundness facts the recursion engine supplies, as `structure`
fields the headline takes as hypotheses (each realizable: it is the standard SNARK soundness of a
fixed verifier circuit, which `DESIGN-recursion-aggregation-private-joint-turns.md` §H1 argues is a
BOUNDED obligation for plonky3's single fixed verifier AIR + differential testing):

  * **`InnerProofSound`** — an inner whole-turn step proof that VERIFIES attests the verified executor
    ran that turn (`recCexec pre turn = some post`). This is the EffectVm/descriptor
    circuit⟺executor soundness, ALREADY proved per-effect in Lean (`WholeTurnTriangle`,
    `EffectVmEmit*`) — here lifted to the leaf-proof boundary as the realized hypothesis the
    recursion engine carries up.
  * **`BindingAirSound`** — a `TurnChainBindingAir` leaf proof that VERIFIES attests the temporal
    tooth `new_root[i] == old_root[i+1]` over the whole chain (`HistoryAggregation.ChainBound`). The
    AIR's continuity constraint is `ivc_turn_chain.rs:246`; its in-circuit soundness is what the leaf
    proof's verification delivers.
  * **`RecursiveVerifierSound`** — an AGGREGATE proof that VERIFIES attests EVERY wrapped child leaf
    proof verifies. This is the recursion engine's in-circuit verifier (`verify_p3_batch_proof_circuit`
    run as a circuit, `prove_aggregation_layer`) being sound — the ONE big FRI obligation (§H1), the
    part outside Lean.

EVERYTHING ELSE — that these three, COMPOSED, yield the full `WellFormedChain` attestation, and hence
the whole-history correctness + conservation — is PROVED here in Lean, gap-free. The composition is
the load-bearing content: it is where a real aggregation bug (verify proof-of-step-7 but export
step-3's roots; swap a leg; drop a turn) would HAVE to show up, and the proof shows the named
hypotheses leave no such gap.

`#assert_axioms`-clean (⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}). The named
hypotheses are `structure` FIELDS, not axioms — they appear in the theorem statements, witnessed
non-vacuously (§5: a realizing instance exists). Verified with
`lake build Dregg2.Circuit.RecursiveAggregation`.

/-! ## 0. The SNARK proof object + verifier (opaque carriers).

`Proof` is an abstract STARK/recursion proof (the `RecursionCompatibleProof` /
`RecursionOutput` of `plonky3_recursion_impl`). `verify` is the native verifier
(`verify_recursive_batch_proof`). We treat them as opaque — the WHOLE point is that the light client
calls `verify` and nothing else. Soundness of `verify` w.r.t. the protocol is supplied by the named
hypotheses; we never inspect a proof's internals. -/

/-! ## 1. The aggregate artifact — the light client's whole view.

`Aggregate` is the `WholeChainProof` (`ivc_turn_chain.rs:430`): the single root recursion proof, plus
the PUBLIC commitments it exposes — `genesisRoot`, `finalRoot`, `chainDigest`, `numTurns`. The light
client sees ONLY these public values + the root proof; it does NOT see the chain's steps or states.
The `leafProofs` / `bindingProof` are the children the engine folded; they live INSIDE the prover and
are reachable to the LIGHT CLIENT only through `RecursiveVerifierSound` (it learns they verify, not
their contents). -/

/-- The succinct aggregate the light client verifies. `root` is the single folded recursion proof;
the four public commitments are exactly the `WholeChainProof` fields. The `leafProofs` are the per-turn
whole-turn proofs and `bindingProof` the chain-binding leaf — folded into `root`. -/

/-! ## 2. The named, realizable soundness hypotheses (the boundary).

These are the three facts the recursion engine supplies that we CANNOT prove in Lean (FRI/recursion
soundness). They are bundled in `EngineSound` as a hypothesis the headline takes — NOT an axiom. The
section variables `CH RH cmb compress compressN` are the §8 commitment portal `HistoryAggregation`
uses; an `Aggregate` is interpreted against a concrete chain `steps` from genesis `g`. -/

  leaf proof attests ITS paired step's verified-executor transition `recCexec pre turn = some post`.

  endpoints. The chain-binding AIR's in-circuit soundness. -/

      ∧ agg.finalRoot = foldedFinalRoot CH RH cmb compress compressN g steps

/-! ## 3. THE LIGHT-CLIENT HEADLINE — verifying the aggregate attests the WHOLE history.

The light client runs `verify agg.root` and NOTHING ELSE. We prove: if that one check passes (and the
engine is sound, the named hypotheses), then EVERY turn in the history executed correctly, the chain
is correctly ordered, and the final root is the genuine fold of the whole history. No re-witnessing. -/

/-- Helper: from a positional pairing `Forall₂ (fun p s => verify p → executed s) ps ss` and the
fact that ALL paired proofs verify, every step executed. Induction on the `Forall₂` witness with the
"all verify" premise generalized. -/

    · exact ih (fun q hq => hall q (List.mem_cons_of_mem p hq)) a hrest

/-- **`every_leaf_verifies_implies_executed`.** From the recursion-soundness + leaf-soundness
hypotheses, a verifying root implies every step's verified-executor transition holds. The chain of
in-circuit verifications collapses to "every turn executed correctly" — `recursive_sound` (root ⇒
leaves verify) composed with `leaf_sound` (positional pairing ⇒ each step executed). -/

  obtain ⟨hleaves, _hbind⟩ := es.recursive_sound hroot
  exact forall₂_all_verify_executed Proof verify es.leaf_sound hleaves

/-- **`AggregateAttests agg g steps`** — the full attestation the light client obtains: every turn
executed correctly, the chain is correctly ordered, the whole chain is a verified-executor `Run` from
genesis, and the public roots are pinned to the genuine endpoints. This is `WellFormedChain`'s
content, delivered to a client that checked ONLY the succinct root. -/

/-- **`light_client_verifies_whole_history` (THE MAGNESIUM→GOLD HEADLINE).**

A light client that checks ONLY `verify agg.root = true` (re-witnessing NOTHING) obtains
`AggregateAttests`: every turn executed correctly, the chain is correctly ordered (no reorder/drop/
insert), and the public final root is the genuine fold of the whole history — UNDER the named,
realizable engine-soundness hypotheses. The verification of the succinct aggregate IS the trust in
the whole history; proofs are additive attestation, and this theorem is exactly that statement,
gap-free. -/

    (agg : Aggregate Proof) (g : RecChainedState) (steps : List ChainStep)

    , ordered := hbound
    , final_is_genuine_fold := hfin
    , genesis_pinned := hgen }

/-! ## 4. The RUN + CONSERVATION the light client inherits (no re-execution).

`AggregateAttests` gives the per-step executor transitions + the ordering; composed with state-level
continuity (the strong form the root tooth recovers under CR, `HistoryAggregation.root_tooth_pins_-
state`), it yields a full `Run recChainedSystem` from genesis, hence conservation over the WHOLE
history — all WITHOUT the light client re-running a single turn. We expose the run + conservation
directly from the `StateChained` witness the prover supplies (the chain's executor genuineness), which
the aggregate attests is consistent with the verified leaves. -/

/-- **`attested_history_is_run`.** Given the executor-genuine chain (`StateChained` — the
prover's witness that the steps are a real run, which the verifying leaves attest step-by-step), the
whole attested history is a `Run recChainedSystem` from genesis to the folded endpoint. The light
client inherits every run-level theorem of the verified record cell.

NOTE (the run vs conservation split): a full `Run recChainedSystem` is a relation on `RecChainedState`
configs, so composing the steps requires the receipt LOG to chain (`s.post = s'.pre`), which the §8
state commitment does NOT bind (it commits the kernel, not the log). The full `Run` therefore genuinely
needs `StateChained`. CONSERVATION, by contrast, reads only the kernel — so it is derivable from the
VERIFIED root without `StateChained`; that is `conserves_from_verification` below (the CRITICAL-3
closure). The log being uncommitted is the exact, named residual: it blocks the full RUN, never
conservation. -/
theorem attested_history_is_run
    (g : RecChainedState) (steps : List ChainStep) (hch : StateChained g steps) :
    Run recChainedSystem g (lastStateOf g steps) :=
  wellformed_is_run g steps hch

/-- **`attested_history_conserves` (KEYSTONE).** Value is conserved across the WHOLE attested
history: the ledger total at the folded endpoint equals the genesis total. A light client trusting the
aggregate trusts a no-mint/no-burn history of arbitrary length, having re-executed nothing. Rides
`HistoryAggregation.wellformed_history_conserves`.

This form takes `StateChained` as a hypothesis (the legitimate producer-supplied path —
`Argus/Aggregate.lean` DERIVES `StateChained` from the genuine producer run). The verification-derived
form that needs NO such hypothesis is `conserves_from_verification` below. -/
theorem attested_history_conserves
    (g : RecChainedState) (steps : List ChainStep) (hch : StateChained g steps) :
    recTotal (lastStateOf g steps).kernel = recTotal g.kernel :=
  wellformed_history_conserves g steps hch

/-! ### CRITICAL-3 CLOSURE — conservation-over-history DERIVED from `verify agg.root`, no `StateChained`.

The critique: `attested_history_conserves` takes `StateChained` (state continuity) as a SEPARATE
prover-supplied hypothesis — exactly what a malicious prover controls — and the tool that could close
it (`root_tooth_pins_state`) recovered only commitment-equality, not state-equality. We close it:
the strengthened `HistoryAggregation.root_tooth_pins_kernel` recovers KERNEL-equality from the verified
root tooth (under the standard Poseidon CR set + the preserved `AccountsWF` invariant), and
`verified_history_conserves` rides that to conservation through `KernelChained` — so conservation
follows from `verify agg.root` itself (which delivers the `ChainBound` tooth via `AggregateAttests`),
plus the genesis pin + the non-cryptographic structural envelope `SeamStruct`. The `StateChained`
hypothesis is GONE from the conservation headline. -/

/-- **`conserves_from_verification` (THE CRITICAL-3 HEADLINE — conservation from `verify agg.root`).**
A light client that checks ONLY `verify agg.root = true` (re-witnessing NOTHING) learns the WHOLE
history conserves value — the ledger total at the folded endpoint equals the genesis total — with NO
`StateChained` hypothesis. The verified root gives `AggregateAttests` (hence the `ChainBound` root
tooth); under the standard Poseidon CR set + the genesis pin + the structural envelope `SeamStruct`
(matched turns + the preserved `AccountsWF` invariant, both non-cryptographic, neither a
state-continuity assertion), `verified_history_conserves` DERIVES kernel continuity from that tooth
(`root_tooth_pins_kernel`) and rides it to conservation. This is the exact gap the critique flagged,
closed: "trusting the aggregate trusts a no-mint/no-burn history" now follows from VERIFICATION, not
from the prover's honesty about state continuity. (The receipt LOG — the one `RecChainedState`
component the §8 root does not bind — blocks only the full `Run`, never conservation; named, not
hidden.) -/

/-! ## 5. NON-VACUITY — the named hypotheses are REALIZABLE (witnessed BOTH ways).

The headline would be hollow if `EngineSound` were unsatisfiable, or if `verify agg.root = true`
could not occur. We exhibit a CONCRETE realizing instance over the `HistoryAggregation.honestStep`
chain (a real 1-step executor run over the teeth genesis): a `verify` that accepts, an `Aggregate`
whose root/leaf/binding all verify, and an `EngineSound` proof — so the headline fires on a real
chain and concludes a real `AggregateAttests`. We ALSO witness the negative: a `verify` that REJECTS
gives a vacuously-true `EngineSound` (no obligation), and the headline is not invoked — the tooth is
in the `binding_sound`/`leaf_sound` implications, which §6 shows separate honest from
tampered. -/

# Lean: circuit soundness & unfoolability

What this subsystem IS at HEAD. The Lean proof that a light client which verifies a
batch proof and **runs nothing else** cannot be fooled: every accepted proof decodes
to a genuine kernel transition whose endpoints are the published commitments. Lives
under `metatheory/Dregg2/Circuit/` (the soundness story) and
`metatheory/Dregg2/Lightclient/` (the verifier-side data structures). Every
load-bearing claim below is cited to a `Module.decl` or file:line.

This is the Lean companion to the Rust `docs/reference/circuit.md` (the
prove/verify crates). Here the object is the *theorem*, not the prover.

## The target (what soundness means)

`Dregg2.Circuit.CircuitSoundness` states the goal directly: a light client verifies a
batch proof against the live VK and runs nothing; soundness is

> `verifyBatch vk pi π = accept ⟹ ∃ a genuine kernel transition s ⟶ s'` with
> `pi.pre = stateCommit s ∧ pi.post = stateCommit s'`

(`CircuitSoundness.lean:11-14`). The "genuine kernel transition" is the declarative
kernel `ActionDispatch.fullActionStep`, composed over a turn by `turnSpec` and
identified with the real executor `execFullTurnA` via `execFullTurnA_iff_turnSpec`
(`CircuitSoundness.lean:16-21`).

## The three load-bearing pieces

1. **`StateDecode`** — the faithful witness→kernel-state decode
   (`CircuitSoundness.StateDecode`, `CircuitSoundness.lean:187`). It says the
   witness's published OLD/NEW commitments *equal* the surface commitment of the
   bound kernels (`preBinds`/`postBinds`) over a fixed `CommitSurface`, and that
   those kernels are `AccountsWF`. Faithfulness is **not assumed**: it is a theorem.
   `stateDecode_pre_faithful` / `stateDecode_post_faithful`
   (`CircuitSoundness.lean:201`, `:210`) prove that two states decoding the *same*
   published commitment have *equal* kernels — by `CommitSurface.commit_binds`
   (`CircuitSoundness.lean:144`), which is `recStateCommit_binds_kernel` repackaged:
   the commitment binds the kernel under the Poseidon CR set, using **no** authority
   gate and **no** frame assumption.

2. **`descriptorRefines d kstep`** — the per-effect rung
   (`CircuitSoundness.descriptorRefines`, `CircuitSoundness.lean:232`): any
   `Satisfied2` witness of descriptor `d` whose published commitments decode (via a
   faithful `StateDecode`) to `pre`/`post` forces `kstep pre post`. Its antecedent is
   the named hash-CR carrier `Poseidon2SpongeCR hash` (`:234`) — the floor the
   per-descriptor published-PI↔limb binding consumes. This is the genuine obligation
   each effect discharges; the apex carries the registry-wide family of these.

3. **`lightclient_unfoolable`** — the apex (`CircuitSoundness.lean:453`). Its only
   data inputs are what a light client actually has — the public inputs `pi` and the
   proof `π`. It does **not** take `pre`/`post` or a `StateDecode` as hypotheses;
   those would hide the hardest rung. Instead it *derives* the decode from named
   floors and concludes the existence of a genuine kernel boundary.

## The apex and its carried floors

```
theorem lightclient_unfoolable
    (hash) (S : CommitSurface) (R : Registry)
    (hCR : Poseidon2SpongeCR hash) [StarkSound hash R]
    (kstep) (hrefines : ∀ e, descriptorRefines S hash (R e) (kstep e))
    (pi) (π) (hwitdec : WitnessDecodes hash R S pi)
    (hacc : verifyBatch (vkOfRegistry R) pi π = accept) :
    ∃ pre post, StateDecode S pi.toPublished pre post ∧ kstep pi.effect pre post
              ∧ pi.pre = S.commit pre.kernel pi.turn
              ∧ pi.post = S.commit post.kernel pi.turn
```
(`CircuitSoundness.lean:453-465`). The derivation chain: `StarkSound` extracts a
`Satisfied2` witness of the *claimed* descriptor whose published commitments are
`pi.toPublished` → `WitnessDecodes` produces `pre`/`post` with a `StateDecode` →
`hrefines` turns witness + decode into `kstep pi.effect pre post` → the decode's
binding re-exports `pi.pre`/`pi.post` as the genuine endpoint commitments
(`CircuitSoundness.lean:466-479`).

The **carried obligations ledger** — every named, deferred premise (nothing
laundered to `True` or an open hole):

- **`StarkSound hash R`** (`class`, `CircuitSoundness.lean:382`) — the audited p3
  batch-STARK soundness / FRI extraction: a verifying batch yields a `Satisfied2`
  witness of the claimed descriptor whose published PI agree with `pi`. Realizable,
  audited, **not provable in Lean**; carried as a class.
- **`Poseidon2SpongeCR hash`** + the `CommitSurface` CR fields (`CommitSurface`,
  `CircuitSoundness.lean:113-134`) — the standard Poseidon collision-resistance set
  (`cmbInj`, `compInj`, `compNInj`, `leafInj`, `restFrame`) the full-state root
  `recStateCommit` binds under. Realizable; bundled, never an axiom.
- **`hrefines`** — the per-effect refinement family, the genuine remaining rung work
  (discharged effect-by-effect downstream).
- **`WitnessDecodes hash R S pi`** (`def`, `CircuitSoundness.lean:446`) — the
  witness→kernel-state **existence** rung: a witness publishing `pi` decodes to some
  `(pre, post)`. A light client cannot supply `pre`/`post`; this rung supplies them
  (the surjectivity of the commitment surface on the published roots). Carried
  explicitly, never discharged by assuming the conclusion.

The minimal honest STARK-batch interface (`VerifyKey`, `vkOfRegistry`,
`BatchPublicInputs`, `verifyBatch`, `Verdict.accept`, `StarkSound`,
`tracePublishedCommit`) is **defined here** because none existed
(`CircuitSoundness.lean:290-387`); `verifyBatch` is `opaque` — the apex reasons only
through the verdict and the `StarkSound` extraction (`:351-353`).

## Scope — what the apex proves, and the freshness boundary

`lightclient_unfoolable` proves **single-transition** soundness: every accepted batch
decodes to a genuine kernel step committing to `pi.pre`/`pi.post`, taking `pi.turn`
as given. It establishes **nothing** about whether that transition is *fresh*
(unreplayed) or its ordering (`CircuitSoundness.lean:412-435`).

Cross-turn freshness / no-replay is a **separate** theorem,
`Dregg2.Circuit.CrossTurnFreshness`. `no_replay` (`CrossTurnFreshness.lean:164`)
proves a proof is applicable at most once; `replay_rejected_after_apply`
(`:177`) is the mutation-confirm. It rides the agent nonce bound *into*
`recStateCommit` (it lives in the agent cell's leaf and strictly increases each
turn, so the commitment sequence never cycles) — `commit_neq_of_nonce_neq`
(`:72`), `TurnChain.commit_no_repeat` (`:130`). The named residual is wiring the
full `runTurn`-driven accepted sequence into a monotone `TurnChain`; the
prologue-bump legs are proved (`runTurn_failed_strictly_advances`, `:229`;
`runTurn_strictly_advances_agentNonce`, `:246`).

## Whole-turn composition: the chain and its derived frame

§4–§9 of `CircuitSoundness` lift the single-effect apex to a whole turn. A turn is a
`List` of per-step circuit witnesses, each publishing its own OLD/NEW commitment (the
prover's chained-root column). The cross-step **frame** — that one step's post-state
*is* the next step's pre-state — is **derived, not assumed**:

- `stateDecodeChain_frame_continuous` (`CircuitSoundness.lean:279`) — equal published
  seam commitments + faithfulness force `a.post.kernel = b.pre.kernel`.
- `TurnDecodeChain` (`structure`, `CircuitSoundness.lean:570`) — a turn threaded
  left-to-right; `turnDecodeChain_seam_kernel_derived` (`:593`) proves the kernel
  half of every seam from the published kernel-root column (the frame **tooth**: a
  prover whose published seam disagrees with the threaded kernel is rejected).
- `turnDecodeChain_refines_turnSpec` (`:633`) folds the per-step `descriptorRefines`
  along the chain into `∃ acts, turnSpec start acts fin`.
- `lightclient_turn_unfoolable_forest` (`:836`) — the whole-turn headline: a verified
  turn + the per-effect family + floors ⟹ a genuine `execFullTurnA s acts = some s'`
  whose endpoints commit to the published turn-level `(pre, post)`.

### The receipt-log seam (§9)

`recStateCommit` is kernel-only — it does not bind the `RecChainedState.log` receipt
chain — so the full-state seam carried its **log** half as a free residue. §9 closes
it, mirroring the kernel tooth: `LogDecode` (`CircuitSoundness.lean:891`) binds
published log commitments to `pre.log`/`post.log` through the realizable
`logHashInjective LH` carrier; `logDecodeChain_frame_continuous` (`:914`) forces
`a'.log = b.log` across a seam; `turnDecodeChainLog_seam_full_derived` (`:985`)
recovers the whole `RecChainedState` continuity `a.post = b.pre` on both components;
`turnDecodeChainLog_rejects_forged_log` (`:1008`) is the mutation-confirm — a forged
intermediate receipt-log is UNSAT. Non-vacuity of the `logHashInjective` carrier is
exhibited inline (`:1031` — a collapsing hash cannot be injective).

## The closed apex and the per-effect taxonomy

`lightclient_unfoolable` carries `hrefines : ∀ e, descriptorRefines …` as a
hypothesis. The closure layer *discharges* that family from genuine per-effect rungs:

- `Dregg2.Circuit.ClosureAll` holds one `<effect>_closedLog` rung per effect family
  (transfer tag 0 `transfer_closedLog`, `ClosureAll.lean:152`; cellSeal 52, revoke 2,
  delegate 1, attenuate 12, mint 3, burn 4, noteSpend 27, … — 55 `_closedLog`
  theorems covering the effect set). Each is a one-liner over the generic combinator
  `closedLog_of_encode` (`:121`): it derives the `.log` advance through
  `logHashInjective` and bridges to `kstepAll` via the effect's landed
  `<effect>_descriptorRefines` rung. The dominant class is **CLASS A** — the
  effect's write is *forced from a deployed `Satisfied2` descriptor* (e.g.
  `cellSeal_closedLog_sat` forces the seal from the deployed `cellSealV3`,
  `ClosureAll.lean:189`; the cap family from `delegateWriteCapOpenV3`,
  `revokeCapabilityV3`, `attenuateCapOpenEffV3`, etc., `:983-1198`), not a modelled
  gate. The earlier per-effect refinement classes (`VALUE_FORCED`,
  whole-kernel-freeze) appear in `RotatedKernelRefinement*` (e.g.
  `RotatedKernelRefinementMisc.lean:30,629`).

- `Dregg2.Circuit.ClosureFinal` bundles them into **one** parametric floor.
  `ClosedWitness` (`structure`, `ClosureFinal.lean:131`) carries, for the published
  effect only, the `WitnessDecodes` existence rung + the single `ClosedLogExtract`
  decode + the `logHashInjective` log enrichment — "one floor, parametric in
  `pi.effect`; NOT a 36-way family" (`:117-123`).
  `lightclient_unfoolable_circuit_sound` (`:161`) is the headline on exactly the
  standard SNARK-soundness foundations. `closedWitness_of_readouts` (`:202`) builds
  that floor from the genuine `ClosureReadouts` bundle whose `ext` routes through
  every proven `<e>_closedLog` rung (`:190-196`) — keeping the per-effect rungs
  load-bearing, not decorative.

- `Dregg2.Circuit.ClosureForest.lightclient_unfoolable_circuit_sound_turn`
  (`ClosureForest.lean:144`) is the **whole-turn closed apex** over heterogeneous
  effects (`hidx` identifies each step's descriptor as `Rfix e` for any effect, freely
  mixed) — no transfer-only residual. Non-vacuity is exhibited:
  `closedLogExtract_family_covers_mixed` (`:190`) inhabits the rung at cellSeal/revoke/
  mint simultaneously; `lightclient_unfoolable_circuit_sound_turn_empty` (`:239`)
  shows the floors jointly compose.

- `Dregg2.Circuit.CircuitSoundnessAssembled` instantiates the apex at the concrete
  `Rfix`/`kstepAll`/`hrefinesAll`: `kstepAll := dispatchArm`
  (`CircuitSoundnessAssembled.lean:380`), `EffectDecodeBridge` *is*
  `descriptorRefines … (kstepAll e)` (`:410`), and `hrefinesAll` (`:427`) assembles
  the per-effect bridge family into the apex's `∀`.
  `lightclient_unfoolable_assembled` (`:440`) and
  `lightclient_turn_unfoolable_forest_assembled` (`:463`) are the capstones.

## Whole-history aggregation (the light client over a chain)

`Dregg2.Circuit.RecursiveAggregation` lifts single-turn soundness to a whole history.
`light_client_verifies_whole_history` (`RecursiveAggregation.lean:200`): a verified
aggregate root attests every per-step executor transition, the ordering, the genesis
pin, and a genuine final fold (`AggregateAttests`). `attested_history_is_run`
(`:234`) exposes the whole history as a `Run recChainedSystem` from genesis;
`attested_history_conserves` (`:247`) and the verification-derived
`conserves_from_verification` (the CRITICAL-3 closure, `:252` ff.) inherit
conservation over the whole history **without re-executing a single turn**. The named
residual is exactly the uncommitted receipt **log**: it blocks the full `Run` (which
needs `StateChained`) but never conservation, which reads only the kernel
(`:227-233`).

## Settlement soundness

`Dregg2.Circuit.SettlementSoundness.settlement_soundness`
(`SettlementSoundness.lean:210`) extends single-transition unfoolability across a
settlement: authority is live-at-settlement (`settled_revocation_bounded` `:139`,
`settled_revocation_immediate` `:150`, `finalized_commit_binds_revoked` `:168`).
`settlement_soundness_single_machine` (`:251`) is the n=1 collapse; `settlement_bites`
/ `settlement_gap_real` (`:314`,`:324`) witness it non-vacuous.

## The light-client data structures

#assert_axioms Dregg2.Apps.CapSlotFactory.stored_cap_only_fresh_if_epoch_unrevoked
#assert_axioms Dregg2.Apps.CapSlotFactory.revoke_stales_stored_cap
#assert_axioms Dregg2.Apps.CapSlotFactory.store_then_revoke_refused

/-! ===========================================================================
## Guarantee E — UNFOOLABILITY

*A light client verifying a Q-chain learns A–D for the WHOLE history; re-witnessing nothing.*

This is the apex that COMPOSES A–D over an entire history and hands them to a verifier who
runs nothing but `verify agg.root`.

DAG:
  • `Circuit.RecursiveAggregation.light_client_verifies_whole_history` — THE headline:
    checking ONLY `verify agg.root` (re-witnessing NOTHING) ⇒ every turn executed correctly,
    correctly ordered, and the final root is a genuine fold. Proofs-as-additive-attestation.
  • `Circuit.RecursiveAggregation.attested_history_conserves` — the whole attested history
    conserves (guarantee B, lifted to the full run).
  • `Circuit.RecursiveAggregation.tampered_aggregate_cannot_bind` — the ANTI-GHOST: a
    reordered chain forces `ChainBound = False`, so no verifying aggregate exists.
  • `Circuit.RecursiveAggregation.leaf_pairing_defeats_swap` — positional pairing means a
    verifying leaf is not re-pointable to a different step.
    the seam tooth `new_root[i] = old_root[i+1]` pins the whole history.
  • `Distributed.HistoryAggregation.root_tooth_pins_kernel` — the STRENGTHENED CR recovery: a light
    client seeing only the matching roots learns the adjacent KERNELS coincide (state-equality, not
    merely commitment-equality), via `recStateCommit_binds_kernel` under the standard Poseidon CR set
    + the preserved `AccountsWF` invariant. This is what `root_tooth_pins_state` (commitment-equality
    only) could not deliver — the CRITICAL-3 fix.
  • `Circuit.RecursiveAggregation.conserves_from_verification` — THE CONSERVATION-OVER-HISTORY CLOSURE:
    conservation across the whole history follows from `verify agg.root` ALONE (the verified `ChainBound`
    tooth ⇒ kernel continuity ⇒ conservation), with NO prover-supplied `StateChained` hypothesis. The
    one `RecChainedState` component the §8 root does not bind is the receipt LOG; it blocks the full
    `Run` (which `attested_history_is_run` still takes `StateChained` for), never conservation — the
    exact, named residual.
  • `Circuit.Argus.Aggregate.argus_strand_light_client` + `tampered_argus_strand_rejected` —
    the Argus-strand realization of the same case on the executable term IR.

Floor: FRI / STARK soundness (`EngineSound.recursive_sound`, the ONE recursion obligation),
Poseidon2-CR (`recStateCommit` binds the seam roots), ed25519 (strand-block signatures),
PostGSTProgress (a FINALIZED — not merely valid — chain, via the finality-cert leg).

/-- **`unfoolability_guarantee` (NOW A REAL STATEMENT — the whole-history headline, conjoined).**
The unfoolability apex, stated as an actual proposition rather than a `True` anchor: a light client
that checks ONLY `verify agg.root = true` (re-witnessing NOTHING) learns BOTH (1) `AggregateAttests`
— every turn executed correctly, the chain is correctly ordered (no reorder/drop/insert), and the
public final root is the genuine fold of the whole history — AND (2) the WHOLE history conserves value
(the endpoint ledger total equals genesis), DERIVED FROM VERIFICATION under the standard Poseidon CR
set + the genesis pin + the structural envelope, with NO prover-supplied `StateChained` hypothesis
(the CRITICAL-3 closure). So E genuinely COMPOSES A–D over the whole history handed to a
`verify agg.root`-only client. This conjoins `light_client_verifies_whole_history` with
`conserves_from_verification`; the game-based reduction (`LightClientUC.unfoolable_of_floor`) and the
anti-ghost teeth (`tampered_aggregate_cannot_bind`) are pinned below. -/

⚑ GROUNDED SOURCE-OF-TRUTH (committed, grounded to file:line at HEAD): `docs/reference/` is now the what-is reference for the whole system — start at `docs/reference/lean-circuit.md` (circuit soundness/unfoolability), `lean-assurance.md` (the five guarantees), `lean-authority.md` (the macaroon↔cap bridge). When a memory claim and `docs/reference/` disagree, the doc wins (it's regenerated against HEAD).

THE PROPERTY: `verifyBatch accept ⟹ ∃ a genuine kernel transition committing to the published (pre,post)` — a light client that runs nothing but the verifier cannot be fooled. Map + state: `metatheory/CLAIMS.md` (§OPEN is the real-debt list, build-enforced), `metatheory/docs/COMPOSITION-SOUNDNESS-CENSUS.md` (the turn/turn-sequence seam census), `metatheory/docs/RECURSION-AGGREGATION-CENSUS.md` (the whole-history fold), `docs/CIRCUIT-FUNCTIONAL-CORRECTNESS.md` (the per-effect obligation table = a proven-class taxonomy). The `Dregg2.lean` per-import annotations are a rich, current per-module map.

⚑⚑⚑ THE APEX + THE FIVE GUARANTEES + THE CROWN ARE `#assert_axioms`-CLEAN-CLOSED (verified at HEAD `1097938e3`). The corpus carries ZERO open holes (`sorry`/`admit`/`native_decide`) — whole-corpus scan = 0; the only `axiom`-keyword decls are the two named DEMO axioms in `Widget/Basic.lean`. `lake env lean Dregg2/Claims.lean` is the build-enforced ledger (165 theorem pins + 50 namespace pins), failing loudly if any keystone regresses to an open-hole axiom.

WHAT IS CLOSED (every theorem's `collectAxioms` is exactly `{propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}`):
- **The light-client apex** `theorem lightclient_unfoolable` (`Dregg2/Circuit/CircuitSoundness.lean:453`, `#assert_axioms`-pinned `:1058`) — `accept ⟹ ∃ pre post, StateDecode ∧ kstep ∧ pre/post commit to the published roots`; data inputs are ONLY what a light client holds (`pi`, `π`) — no `pre`/`post`/`StateDecode` smuggled in. Carries the named crypto floor only: `StarkSound` (FRI extraction), `Poseidon2SpongeCR`, the per-effect `descriptorRefines` family, `WitnessDecodes`. (This IS a real theorem of that name — NOT a phantom. Source-of-truth: `docs/reference/lean-circuit.md:48,57`.)
- **The five guarantee apexes** (`Dregg2/AssuranceCase.lean`, each home-pinned + re-pinned): `authority_guarantee` (`:166`), `conservation_guarantee` (`:259`), `integrity_guarantee` (`:412`, + `_whole_turn` `:452`), `freshness_guarantee` (`:581`), `unfoolability_guarantee` (`:666`). The whole-history headline is `RecursiveAggregation.light_client_verifies_whole_history`; `Crypto.LightClientUC.unfoolable_of_floor` reduces light-client soundness to STARK/Fiat-Shamir extractability + sponge-CR, and `fooling_breaks_floor` extracts a concrete floor-break from any fooling attack. (Note: `lean-assurance.md` is right that the *AssuranceCase aggregation* has no theorem literally named `lightclient_unfoolable` — that name lives in `CircuitSoundness.lean`; the assurance apex is `unfoolability_guarantee`. Both real, different homes.) Source-of-truth: `docs/reference/lean-assurance.md`.
- **THE CAP-RESHAPE CROWN (ARGUS linchpin #103) LANDED** — `capReshapeVmDescriptor` (`Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/EffectVmEmitCapReshape.lean`): in-row sites RECOMPUTE the held-entry leaf + the openable `capability_root` (depth-16 sorted-Poseidon2), and the gates force non-amp + production-authority over the GENUINE `is_attenuation` lattice (`Cap`/`ExecAuth = Finset Auth`, NOT a bare bitwise mask). The teeth: `capReshape_nonAmp_in_circuit` (a satisfying witness FORCES the submask non-amp), `capReshape_production_in_circuit` (forces the held-cap-controls-the-well production leg), and the two-valued anti-ghost `capReshape_rejects_amplify` + `capReshape_rejects_no_control`. All `#assert_axioms`-clean. The cap_root↔is_attenuation weld + the production-authority leg are no longer a "plan" (see the closed plan, folded below).
- **Whole-history aggregation** — `light_client_verifies_whole_history` (`Dregg2/Circuit/RecursiveAggregation.lean`, sorry-free, axiom-clean): one constant-cost check yields `AggregateAttests` (every turn executed, chain correctly ordered, final root is the genuine fold). `conserves_from_verification` rides the same root with no prover-supplied continuity; `tampered_aggregate_cannot_bind` + `leaf_pairing_defeats_swap` are the chain-level anti-ghost teeth. This is LIVE-WIRED: `circuit-prove/src/ivc_turn_chain.rs::prove/verify_turn_chain_recursive` (real plonky3 in-circuit FRI recursion) ← `lightclient/src/lib.rs::verify_history` (line 147). dregg ALREADY does the Mina-Pickles-shaped succinct-whole-chain thing, with a Lean-proven composition Mina lacks (see RECURSION-AGGREGATION-CENSUS — the "Silver→Golden / future" framing UNDERSTATES the live state). Cross-cell width axis (`bilateral_aggregation_air.rs` → node `/turns/aggregate`) is also live.
- **Whole-history non-forgeability** `Spec.only_connectivity_begets_connectivity` (`Spec/Authority.lean:456`, home-pinned) — the Granovetter closure across an ENTIRE history (the old "confirmed DIRTY" verdict is gone).
- **The distributed extension** `settlement_soundness` (`Metatheory/SettlementSoundness.lean:153`, `#assert_axioms`-clean) — a SETTLED turn exercised a LIVE-at-tip authority; `revoke_before_tip_unsettleable` the operational contrapositive; collapses to immediate at n=1. (`BindsLiveAuthority` is a typed hypothesis the deployed settlement predicate discharges — the named §8-style composition obligation, with `deployedSettle_binds_live_authority` instantiating it.)
- **THE NAMED EPOCH-STAMP RESIDUALS ARE CLOSED.** `SpawnEpochStampResidual` / `RevokeDelegationEpochResidual` / `RefreshEpochStampResidual` (`Circuit/EffectRefinement.lean`, `EffectRefinementBatch2.lean`) each carry the source verdict "CLOSED (NOT an open residual). SUPERSEDED by the deployed `spawnE`/refresh descriptor" — the moving-face descriptor cutover (§3.EPOCH) LANDED; the `delegationEpoch += 1` freshness tick is now in-circuit-forced (`revokeDelegationFullA`, `EffectVmEmitRotationV3.lean`). The hostile-witness extraction lane is fully closed (`Circuit.CircuitOpenFronts.countOpenFronts = 0`, 32/32 effects).
- **The cross-turn replay residual is closed.** `BodyNonceNondecreasing` is DISCHARGED for the live forest body — `forest_body_nonceNondecreasing` (`Circuit/CrossTurnFreshness.lean:1170`, via `execFullForestA_agentNonce_nondecr`); `acceptedSeq_to_TurnChain` wires the abstract `TurnChain` to the accepted-`runTurn` sequence. The COMPOSITION-SOUNDNESS-CENSUS "rank-2" gap is resolved at the assembly.
- **The whole circuit corpus is sorry-free**, including every `CircuitCompleteness*.lean` (sound ∧ complete, the floor asymmetry between directions kept explicit — SOUND needs `WitnessDecodes`+`StarkSound`; COMPLETE needs only `stateDecode_construct`+`StarkComplete`).

THE PER-EFFECT CLASSES (PROVEN INDIVIDUALLY, per `docs/reference/lean-circuit.md` + `docs/CIRCUIT-FUNCTIONAL-CORRECTNESS.md`): at HEAD the DOMINANT per-effect closure label is **CLASS A** — the effect's gate is FORCED from the DEPLOYED v3-registry descriptor (`= Rfix <tag>` by `rfl`) so a satisfying `Satisfied2` witness forces the kernel step (`Dregg2/Circuit/ClosureAll.lean`: cellSeal/receiptArchive/heapWrite/exercise/revoke/delegate/introduce/delegateAtten/… are all annotated CLASS A). The earlier per-effect-refinement labels VALUE_FORCED / RECORD-DIGEST-ANCHORED / MAP-OP-FORCED survive only in a few module headers and the older obligation doc — they describe the *kind of column forced*, not a clean three-way partition of the deployed corpus. Treat CLASS A (Satisfied2-forced) as the live framing; don't recite the three-class taxonomy as the partition. `mint` is forced + deployed under its own `sel::MINT=14` selector + cap-reshape-bound authority (supply Stage 2b, `51488682f`); the cap family (attenuate/delegate/delegateAtten/introduce/revokeCapability) is forced via the cap-reshape crown's recompute+submask; noteSpend forces double-spend non-membership.

THE GENUINE OPEN (CLAIMS.md §OPEN — the real-debt list; honest named residuals, NOT open holes):
- **Composition — the intra-turn receipt-LOG seam** (COMPOSITION-SOUNDNESS-CENSUS seam #3, rank-1): the commitment surface binds `RecChainedState.kernel`, so the KERNEL half of the intra-turn seam is FORCED (`turnDecodeChain_seam_kernel_derived`), but the receipt-LOG continuity is a CARRIED chain field, not yet a forced one. The apex's unfoolability "this is a real kernel evolution" HOLDS; "the receipts are the genuine receipts" is the carried half. Closure = add a log-root limb to `CommitSurface` and re-derive the log half exactly as the kernel half. Small.
- **The un-assembled `∀ e, descriptorRefines (R e) (kstep e)` COMPOSITION** — per-effect rungs are proven; the universally-quantified single assembly over the live registry is the remaining structural fold (the per-turn/per-effect folds `turnDecodeChain_refines_turnSpec` + `lightclient_unfoolable_circuit_sound_turn` ARE proven; the `∀ e` registry-wide statement is the residual).
- **The faithful-encoding carriers** — cap-tree↔Caps, nullifier-tree↔set, the §8 `CryptoKernel`/`Poseidon2SpongeCR` floor (TERMINAL crypto, by design never Lean's). The denotational Lean↔Rust eval-agreement differential is BUILT (`circuit/tests/ir2_denotational_differential.rs`; see [[feedback-byte-identity-differential-is-not-faithfulness]]) — the interpreter edge is no longer a directive.
- **Deployed-side `attenuate` is VALUE_PARTIAL** — the in-circuit submask non-amp is proven and the cap Phase-D membership-into-`capability_root` leg is WIRED (`sdk/src/full_turn_proof.rs` `CapMembershipExpectation` + `verify_full_turn_bound`: root-binding `CapRootMismatch` + leaf-binding `CapLeafMismatch` + leg-present teeth, anti-forgery tests bite). The residual is the v3 registry-cutover (route `attenuate` through the recompute descriptor as its deployed lead), NOT the binding.

CONSENSUS / DISTRIBUTED OPEN (named residual `Prop`s, the partial-synchrony model discharges): CM-liveness/O2-pacemaker (`cm_pacemaker_residual`), CM-dissemination (reliable-broadcast convergence), CM-Stingray (the bandwidth-accounting model; the safety bounds ARE proved), Synchronizer↔operational `World.rand` coupling, `Coordination` mu-recursion projection-progress (the `NoRec` fragment is proved), `Proof.Refine` full abstract forward-simulation (conservation + intra-vat integrity refinements ARE pinned; the missing piece is an abstract small-step relation absent from `Core`), HandlerTransformer upper tiers. These are §8/consensus boundaries, not circuit-soundness holes.

THE MACAROON↔CAP CONVERGENCE ARROW IS PROVEN (no longer a research edge): `theorem chainGateG_implies_capAuthorityG` (`metatheory/Dregg2/Authority/CaveatCapBridge.lean:168`, `#assert_axioms`-pinned at `:606`, plus the non-vacuity twin `chainGateG_implies_capAuthorityG_devac` at `:357`/pin `:592`) — on a coherently-built bridge node, the macaroon caveat-chain narrowing IMPLIES the kernel cap authority `granted ⊆ held`. The four credential aspects (biscuit · macaroon · cap · zk) are the ONE authority seen four ways, and the macaroon→kernel-gate refinement is now a closed Lean theorem, not a `&&`-conjunction hope. The production law is fully proven + in-circuit for the cap aspect (`granted ⊆ held` via `recKDelegateAtten`/`capAuthorityG`/`checkSubset`, witnessed against the authenticated `capability_root`); `CaveatCapBridge` welds the macaroon caveat-chain to it. Source-of-truth doc: `docs/reference/lean-authority.md` §"The convergence arrow". (Earlier memory called this "the honest research edge / joined by `&&` / no theorem `chainGateG → capAuthorityG`" — STALE, the theorem exists and is axiom-clean.)

VK CAVEAT: cap-write/cap-open and supply-mint descriptors are VK-affecting. Drive ALL such artifact work to green + commit (per [[feedback-dont-over-ember-gate]] — the redeploy half is MOOT, the devnet is GONE as of 2026-06-22). The Lean-side fix+proof+registry-swap IS the soundness work. Relates to [[project-perf-kernel-supply-epoch]] (supply Stage 2b), [[project-distributed-houyhnhnm-frontier]] (settlement soundness), [[feedback-named-seam-is-not-a-hole]] (classify each residual: this file's tail is TERMINAL-CRYPTO-FLOOR + small REDUCIBLE-OPEN, not uniform debt), [[feedback-dont-launder-vacuity-as-honest]], [[feedback-conservation-is-not-correctness]].

⚑ GROUNDED WHAT-IS: `docs/reference/` (committed, file:line at HEAD) is the source-of-truth for the live state — `lean-circuit.md`, `lean-assurance.md`, `lean-authority.md`. When this vision-memory and `docs/reference/` disagree, the doc wins.

⚑ **ARGUS** = the vision for an assured circuit. Argus Panoptes, the hundred-eyed guardian nothing escapes — the inverse of **the pale ghost** (this codebase's recurring villain: a proof that looks sound but witnesses a PROJECTION, so it fools the verifier; cf [[feedback-conservation-is-not-correctness]]). The bar: **no-malleability + no-forgotten-precondition + refines**, all the way down to a WORTHWHILE semantics — never lossy inherited cruft.

**⚑ THE ACCEPTANCE CRITERION (ember, the operational threat model — THE bar):** the circuit must attest the PRECISE state transition with (1) **NO MALLEABILITY** — everything binding; the witness uniquely pins the transition (pre/post/params); tamper ANY guarantee-relevant field ⇒ UNSAT; the anti-ghost tooth is COMPLETE (every field) or an adversary re-presents the proof for a swapped amount/target/post-state. (2) **NO FORGOTTEN PRECONDITIONS** — EVERY protocol precondition (authorization, attenuation granted⊆held, balance availability, nonce/freshness, no-double-spend non-membership, lifecycle-live, fee coverage, …) is an IN-CIRCUIT CONJUNCT — the deadly bug is a precondition the EXECUTOR checks but the CIRCUIT omits (the light client sees ONLY the proof). (3) **REFINES/BISIMULATES** — `satisfiedVm(descriptor) ⟹ protocol-valid-transition` (soundness = client-safety) + completeness. THE THREAT = a malicious network feeding a light client (a) proofs over bad data or (b) proofs that forgot a precondition. The guarantee: a verifying aggregate ⇒ every turn protocol-valid, no precondition skipped, no field unbound ⇒ the network CANNOT lead the client astray.

**⚑ THE LINCHPIN LANDED (#103).** The crown — non-amplification (granted⊆held) AND production-authority forced IN-CIRCUIT against the openable `capability_root` — is closed, `#assert_axioms`-clean (`capReshapeVmDescriptor` + `capReshape_nonAmp_in_circuit`/`capReshape_production_in_circuit` + rejection teeth; the SDK `verify_full_turn_bound` binds the cap-membership leg to the canonical root). See [[project-cap-reshape-plan]] for the scheme + the one deployed-route residual, and [[project-circuit-soundness-apex]] for the apex.

**⚑ THE CORE THESIS (from a TCB census): the same disease at every layer — a true theorem whose load-bearing premise is discharged OUT-OF-BAND (executor in-memory / host-side check / a shape-AIR), never IN the verified algebra.** It is ONE disease, not N findings ("things being out-of-band = failure to internalize the guarantees", [[feedback-stop-auditing-internalize-guarantees]]). ARGUS internalizes each premise into the circuit's own statement. A key unlock: **a `witnessed` guard and a circuit obligation are THE SAME THING** — caveats, cell-programs, the Bucket-B StateConstraints, intent-preds, AND the sub-circuits `compile` emits are all the ONE `Guard.witnessed` mechanism; routing a silently-ignored constraint through a `witnessed` arm makes it a circuit proof obligation. The guard IS the circuit, at the predicate level.

**⚑ THE WHOLE STACK IS ONE TRANSFORMER ALGEBRA (don't be effect-myopic):** effect = forward transformer `{P}e{Q}`; turn = `seq`; jointturn = `par`/separation-⊗ (tensor non-finality = the binding is irreducible, not recoverable per-cell); **intent = COEFFECT** (a four-faced `offered⟶wanted` TYPED HOLE + `fulfill` = the counit annihilating intent+filler→receipt); receipt = committed postcondition Q; witness = proof of the VC; strand = temporal `seq` of receipts. **EVERYTHING IS Q AND ITS PROJECTIONS:** effect produces Q, intent demands Q, receipt commits Q, witness proves Q, `Dregg2.Verify` consumes Q (app verifies `Q⟹invariant`), the privacy dial (`DiscloseAt` Trusted/Selective/Private) = a PROJECTION of Q. The dregg2 formalization's FINAL FORM = ONE coherent verified theory: one IR (the transformer algebra) over ONE unified guard/predicate language (`Pred ≅ Caveat ≅ Spec.Guard`, proved isomorphic in `Exec/PredAlgebra.lean`) on the Iris resource tier (`StepCamera.lean`), composing by seq/par/the counit, with `interp`(executor) AND `compile`(circuit) BOTH DERIVED from the one term so they can't drift — NOT 52 bespoke circuit proofs. The lever: REIFY the executor as an IR term (`RecStmt`) and prove a generic transformer sound ONCE (`effect_circuit_full_sound`, the v2–v5 manual unrollings collapse under it).

**⚑ THE ONE-CIRCUIT INVARIANT (ember, load-bearing):** there is EXACTLY ONE circuit / ONE VK / ONE algebraic statement, and it is LEAN-DERIVED. That singular statement IS the protocol's identity. A second circuit = a different VK = a DIFFERENT PROTOCOL. What dregg LEGITIMATELY has is diversity at the EXECUTION/WITNESS level: multiple executor/witness-gen impls (dregg2 Lean executor primary, dreggrs Rust diversity, the Rust witness generator) all proving witnesses to the ONE shared Lean-derived circuit. `lean_descriptor_air.rs` is NOT "a Rust AIR" — it's the Rust interpreter/prover of the one Lean descriptor (KEPT). The hand-written Rust AIRs (`effect_vm/air.rs`, `effect_vm_p3_full_air.rs`) must DIE via verified-replacement, not because "Rust is the differential" but because they would be a second circuit. The differential-against-Rust was itself a TRAP (ditch+fix to one worthwhile semantics, don't model the gap).

**⚑ THE FIDELITY COLUMN (the light client's unfoolability = the TOP, exactly as tall as the shortest layer) — current status:**
0. **kernel state models the full worthwhile committed payload** — the RECORD-DIGEST limb realizes `RestHashIffFrame` over the full kernel; the deployed commitment absorbs `record_digest` folding all authority residue (the old narrow-commitment hole is CLOSED; the commitment differentials `CommitDifferential`/`RotatedCommitDifferential` are non-vacuous).
1. **circuit binds that faithful state, welded to recKExec** — per-effect rungs are PROVEN individually; the dominant closure label at HEAD is **CLASS A** (the gate forced from the deployed v3-registry descriptor `= Rfix <tag>`, `Dregg2/Circuit/ClosureAll.lean`). The older labels VALUE_FORCED / RECORD-DIGEST-ANCHORED / MAP-OP-FORCED linger only in a few headers — they name the kind of column forced, not a clean partition. The cap-graph family is forced via the cap-reshape crown. (Source-of-truth: `docs/reference/lean-circuit.md`.)
2. **the Rust interpreter realizes `satisfiedVm`** — the denotational Lean↔Rust eval-agreement differential is BUILT (`circuit/tests/ir2_denotational_differential.rs`: two real oracles — an independent Lean `Satisfied2` re-impl vs what `Ir2Air::eval` enforces — decide accept/reject identically over a generated corpus, driven through the real deployed multi-table batch STARK). The irreducible seam below it is extracting p3 `eval` into Lean's kernel (TERMINAL by design). See [[feedback-byte-identity-differential-is-not-faithfulness]] — the byte-identity FP is DRIFT DETECTION, not faithfulness; the denotational differential is the faithfulness check, and it exists now.
3. **the turn binds the forest** — the per-turn fold (`turnDecodeChain_refines_turnSpec`, kernel seam DERIVED not assumed) + the closed mixed-effect apex (`lightclient_unfoolable_circuit_sound_turn`) + cohort-chain forcing (`chainForcesEveryCohort`); the cross-turn no-replay is closed (`BodyNonceNondecreasing` discharged for the live forest body). OPEN (small, named): the intra-turn receipt-LOG seam is carried not forced (the kernel half is forced); the node verifier iterates only the lead cohort leg (the SDK already chain-checks all legs — a wiring lift).
4. **the aggregate folds the REAL AIR, not the shape AIR** — LIVE: `ivc_turn_chain` (real plonky3 in-circuit FRI recursion) folds N finalized turns into one constant-cost proof, consumed by `lightclient::verify_history`, Lean-proven gap-free above the FRI floor (`RecursiveAggregation.light_client_verifies_whole_history`). dregg ALREADY does the Mina-Pickles-shaped succinct whole-chain thing, with a machine-checked composition Mina lacks. The two named recursion-fork follow-ups (child-circuit VK identity + cross-layer public-value propagation) + the unbounded online accumulator are the depth-axis residuals.
5. **the light client inherits the whole truth, unfoolable** — `theorem lightclient_unfoolable` (`CircuitSoundness.lean:453`, pin `:1058`) + the five guarantee apexes (`unfoolability_guarantee` `:666` etc., `AssuranceCase.lean`) + the whole-history headline `RecursiveAggregation.light_client_verifies_whole_history` are `#assert_axioms`-clean; `tampered_aggregate_cannot_bind` is the anti-ghost at the TOP. The macaroon→cap convergence arrow `chainGateG_implies_capAuthorityG` (`CaveatCapBridge.lean:168`) is now PROVEN — the four credential aspects are no longer joined by a bare `&&`.

**⚑ METHOD (ember):** NO seam-ledger / no sorted-bucket artifact — that labelling reflex is the disease. Forward = empowered dual auditor-doers who find-and-fix as ONE act, iterating in-lane on tests; the understanding regenerates FROM the doing. Argus shared-base Lean edits (EffectVmEmit/RecordKernel) are serial (no Lean agent racing); Rust lanes farm in parallel on persvati; verify-before-push. Docs say what IS, never what WAS. ⚑ Classify every named residual (TERMINAL-CRYPTO-FLOOR / REDUCIBLE-OPEN / CLOSED) per [[feedback-named-seam-is-not-a-hole]] — the remaining ARGUS tail is small REDUCIBLE-OPEN + the terminal crypto floor, NOT uniform debt. See [[project-circuit-soundness-apex]], [[project-cap-reshape-plan]], [[project-distributed-houyhnhnm-frontier]] (the settlement-soundness extension).

The current Lean model still uses a separate `bindingProof`/`ChainBound` hypothesis shape. The theorem you want is a refinement of that: replace “binding leaf says the chain is bound” with a tree-local recursive statement where each verified node’s exposed segment is proven equal to the fold of exactly its descendant executions.

//! GOLD endgame: a continuous whole-chain IVC accumulator over **finalized turns**.
//!
//! ## What this is
//!
//! [`ivc`](dregg_circuit::ivc) accumulates an *attenuation* fold-chain (delegation
//! depth) into one proof. [`joint_turn_recursive`](crate::joint_turn_recursive)
//! folds the N **per-cell** proofs of a *single* shared turn (the hyperedge
//! apex) into one recursive proof. Neither is the whole-chain accumulator.
//!
//! This module is that accumulator: it folds the sequence of *finalized turn*
//! proofs — in the exact order the node's `tau`/blocklace finality produces
//! (`node::blocklace_sync::poll_finalized_blocks` -> `FinalizedBlock`) — into
//! ONE running recursive proof attesting:
//!
//!   "all turns 1..K executed correctly **and** the finalized state root
//!    advanced correctly from the genesis root to the final root, in that
//!    order."
//!
//! It is the sequential dual of the joint-turn (which is cross-cell at one
//! instant). Here the binding is *temporal*: turn N's post-state root must be
//! turn N+1's pre-state root (`prev.NEW_COMMIT == next.OLD_COMMIT`) — the
//! happened-before chain over the *finalized* order, exactly the property the
//! node's tau ordering establishes.
//!
//! ## The two pieces
//!
//! 1. **[`TurnChainBindingAir`]** (one row per folded position): binds the
//!    sequential chain AND the running ordered-history digest. Each row carries
//!    `[old_root, new_root, acc_in, acc_out, idx, is_real, real_count]` plus the
//!    per-row Poseidon2 permutation aux block, with constraints:
//!      - chain continuity: `new_root[i] == old_root[i+1]` (the temporal tooth);
//!      - first row `old_root == genesis_root` (public input);
//!      - last row `new_root == final_root` (public input);
//!      - **running digest `acc_out == hash_4_to_1([acc_in, old_root, new_root,
//!        idx])` ENFORCED in-circuit** (the genuine round-by-round Poseidon2 of
//!        [`poseidon2_permute_expr`], NOT a free witness column), first row
//!        `acc_in == 0`, last row `acc_out == chain_digest` (public);
//!      - `idx` is a positional counter (`0,1,2,…`) so the digest is positionally
//!        bound;
//!      - `num_turns` (public) is pinned to `real_count[last]`, the cumulative
//!        count of the non-padding (`is_real`) rows.
//!
//!    A trace whose turns are reordered, or that drops/inserts a turn, breaks
//!    continuity and is UNSAT; a forged `chain_digest` has no satisfying Poseidon2
//!    witness; a forged `num_turns` mismatches the real-row count — those are the
//!    load-bearing rejections.
//!
//! 2. **The recursion tree (Gold) — REAL leaves.** Each finalized turn's leaf
//!    is the **Lean-descriptor EffectVM AIR itself** ([`EffectVmDescriptorAir`],
//!    the graduated ONE-circuit cutover constraint set: Poseidon2 state-commit
//!    hash sites, per-row gates, transition continuity, `OLD_COMMIT`/`NEW_COMMIT`
//!    PI bindings, balance range checks), re-proven as a recursion-compatible
//!    uni-STARK over the **same 186-column execution trace** the turn's
//!    production rotated IR-v2 batch proof (the retired v1 `EffectVmP3Proof`)
//!    attests, then wrapped in its own **in-circuit verifier layer**
//!    (uni->batch via `build_and_prove_next_layer`). The chain-binding leaf is
//!    wrapped too, and all batch leaves are pairwise aggregated up a binary tree
//!    (`build_and_prove_aggregation_layer`, chained via [`BatchOnly`]) to ONE
//!    root batch-STARK proof. The verifier checks ONLY the root; its cost is
//!    independent of K.
//!
//! ## What the leaf wrap proves (the statement-equality argument)
//!
//! The production turn artifact is a `p3-batch-stark` proof of
//! `EffectVmDescriptorAir(desc)` over `(extend_vm_trace(base_trace), dpis)`,
//! where `dpis` is the descriptor PI prefix (carrying the chain roots at
//! [`pi::OLD_COMMIT`] / [`pi::NEW_COMMIT`]). The recursion fork's in-circuit
//! verifier consumes uni-STARK proofs under the recursion `StarkConfig`, while
//! the production proof is a batch proof under the audited prover config — two
//! FRI engine instantiations of the SAME constraint set. The fold therefore
//! re-proves the IDENTICAL statement — same AIR (`EffectVmDescriptorAir::eval`,
//! config-agnostic), same extended trace ([`descriptor_recursion_matrix`] =
//! the same `extend_vm_trace` surface `prove_vm_descriptor` uses), same PI
//! prefix — as a recursion-compatible uni-STARK, and THAT proof is verified
//! in-circuit by the wrap layer. A claimed `(old_root, new_root)` with no
//! satisfying execution trace has no satisfying leaf under EITHER config (the
//! descriptor's hash sites force `NEW_COMMIT` to be the genuine Poseidon2
//! post-state commitment), so a prover that skips the host-side gate still
//! CANNOT produce a verifying root for a forged turn — that is the tooth
//! `ungated_prover_with_forged_post_commit_cannot_produce_a_root` bites on.
//!
//! ## What the verifier checks (three teeth, in order)
//!
//! [`verify_turn_chain_recursive`] takes the proof AND a caller-held trust
//! anchor (a [`RecursionVk`] — the root circuit's verifier-key fingerprint,
//! obtained once from an honest setup fold, distributed exactly like any
//! SNARK VK) and refuses unless ALL of:
//!
//!   1. **VK pin** — the root proof's verifier-reconstruction inputs (table
//!      shapes, packing, NPO manifest shape, and the preprocessed Merkle
//!      commitment binding the root verifier circuit's op-list) fingerprint
//!      to the anchor. This closes the from-scratch-prover route through
//!      `verify_recursive_batch_proof`'s reconstruct-from-the-proof
//!      discipline: a root proof of a DIFFERENT circuit no longer verifies
//!      "as if" it were the chain fold. (Guarantee, precisely: under blake3
//!      collision resistance + MMCS binding, the accepted root is a valid
//!      batch-STARK of the SAME root verifier-circuit structure the anchor
//!      was extracted from.)
//!   2. **Claimed-publics attestation** — the carried `genesis_root` /
//!      `final_root` / `num_turns` / `chain_digest` must verify as the public
//!      inputs of the carried chain-binding uni-STARK
//!      (`WholeChainProof::binding_proof`, the same statement the fold wraps
//!      in-circuit). Fiat–Shamir binds all four PIs into that proof, so
//!      relabeling any carried field is refused outright.
//!   3. **The root** — `verify_recursive_batch_proof` on the single root.
//!
//! ## CRITICAL HOLES #1/#2/#6 — CLOSED by the ordered SEGMENT ACCUMULATOR (2026-06-24)
//!
//! A cross-model adversarial review (`docs/CODEX-IVC-SOUNDNESS-REVIEW.md` +
//! `CODEX-IVC-REVIEW-2.md`) found a forged whole-chain claim the verifier ACCEPTS: a
//! root that EXECUTED history A paired with a whole-chain CLAIM for a different history
//! B. The root cause was that the chain claim came from a SEPARATE `TurnChainBindingAir`
//! leaf attesting a hash-chain over CLAIMED roots — never tied in-circuit to the
//! descriptor leaves' ACTUAL roots — so the binding leaf (and its claim) could be swapped
//! or built for a different history than the one the descriptor leaves executed.
//!
//! **THE FIX (codex's ordered segment-accumulator).** The separate binding leaf is GONE
//! from the soundness path. Every DESCRIPTOR leaf carries a constant-size ordered SEGMENT
//! `[first_old, last_new, count, acc]`, exposed through the `expose_claim` table and BOUND
//! IN-CIRCUIT:
//!   - **leaf** ([`prove_descriptor_leaf_rotated_with_segment`]): `first_old`/`last_new`
//!     are the descriptor proof's verified rotated roots (PI `V1_PI_COUNT`/`+1`, read off
//!     the child's `air_public_targets`), `count = 1`, `acc = H(first_old, last_new)`. So
//!     the segment is tied to the ACTUAL execution this leaf re-proves — a prover cannot
//!     expose endpoints that differ from the descriptor it folded.
//!   - **aggregation combine** ([`aggregate_tree`]): both children expose a segment; the
//!     combine constrains STATE CONTINUITY (`L.last_new == R.first_old`), COUNT additivity
//!     (`count = L.count + R.count`), and the ORDERED DIGEST fold (`acc = H(L.acc, R.acc)`,
//!     left≠right ⇒ order-sensitive), then re-exposes the parent segment — up to the root.
//!   - **root + host check** ([`verify_turn_chain_recursive_from_parts`], the SEGMENT
//!     tooth): the root's exposed segment `[first_old, last_new, count, acc]` is the
//!     whole-chain claim derived BY CONSTRUCTION from the real descriptor leaves; the host
//!     checks it equals the carried `[genesis_root, final_root, num_turns, chain_digest]`,
//!     fail-closed. There is NO swappable binding leaf — a root that executed A cannot
//!     expose B's endpoints, so a B-claim against an A-execution is REJECTED.
//!
//! The executable witness `mixed_root_forgery_executes_A_claims_B`
//! (`circuit-prove/tests/ivc_turn_chain_rotated.rs`) asserts the forgery is REJECTED
//! (`is_err`) — the close. The out-of-band swap witness
//! `carried_binding_proof_unlinked_to_root_is_rejected` and the #2 digest/num_turns forge
//! teeth (`binding_air_forged_digest_unsat` / `binding_air_forged_num_turns_unsat`) all
//! still reject. The whole fix is dregg-side — it reuses the EXISTING recursion-fork
//! `expose_claim` channel + the aggregation expose hook (which exposes the
//! `air_public_targets` AND lets the combine add cross-child constraints) + the in-circuit
//! poseidon2 challenger perm; NO fork change was needed.
//!
//! ## The honest residual floor (named, not hidden)
//!
//! - **Engine soundness** (`recursive_sound`): the wrap layer's in-circuit FRI
//!   verifier and the root batch-STARK verifier are the plonky3 recursion
//!   fork's; their soundness is the named crypto carrier, as everywhere else.
//! - **Segment digest — a multi-felt Poseidon2 commitment** ([`seg_poseidon_commit`],
//!   codex re-review #3, CLOSED). The ordered-history `acc` is a genuine
//!   [`SEG_DIGEST_WIDTH`]-felt Poseidon2 sponge over the recursion config's
//!   `BABY_BEAR_D4_W16` challenger permutation (the SAME full-round arithmetization the
//!   FRI challenger uses, CTL-bound against the Poseidon2 AIR), matched host-side by
//!   [`seg_poseidon_commit_host`]. This REPLACED the prior one-felt quadratic fold
//!   `a*M1 + b*M2 + a*b*M3`, which was algebraically broken (a given middle root had a
//!   directly-solvable colliding partner, plus degeneracy roots that made it ignore an
//!   operand). The multi-felt commitment has no algebraic shortcut and ~124-bit collision
//!   resistance, so a same-genesis/same-final/same-count history B with a different middle
//!   now mismatches the root digest. The ONLINE [`crate::accumulator`] is scoped OUT (it
//!   keeps the single-felt binding-leaf carrier, zero-padded to the new lane width — codex
//!   #4 mixed-root weakness for that path is unchanged).
//! - **Child-circuit identity under the VK pin (fork follow-up, precise).** The
//!   harness-level VK pin (tooth 1) pins the ROOT layer's circuit structure; the leaf
//!   circuits' op-list identity is pinned in-band only via the fork's
//!   `into_recursion_input_pinned` path (used by the online [`crate::accumulator`]). For
//!   the balanced-tree K-fold the leaf VK identity rests on the root VK pin + the genuine
//!   same-shape aggregation; baking child preprocessed commitments as checked publics is
//!   the remaining fork follow-up.
//!
//! ## K-fold vs unbounded
//!
//! [`prove_turn_chain_recursive`] folds an arbitrary *finite* K into one proof.
//! This is genuine IVC for a bounded window: the verifier checks one
//! constant-cost root proof for the whole window.
//!
//! The fully *unbounded* online accumulator — where a single running proof is
//! re-folded with each newly-finalized turn forever, with the previous running

The important implementation details are now clear: leaf exposes `[old,new,1,H(old,new)]` from descriptor public targets, combine exposes `[L.first,R.last,L.count+R.count,H(L.acc,R.acc)]` with continuity, and the host compares the root exposed segment to the carried claim. I’m checking the aggregation hook names so the Lean sketch can keep the proof obligations split cleanly.

`ChainBound` is FALSE, so any `EngineSound` whose `binding_sound` fires on such a chain is
CONTRADICTORY (you cannot have a verifying binding proof for a broken order). (b) the leaf↔step
PAIRING (`leaf_sound`'s length+index discipline) defeats leg-swap/drop: a leaf proof is bound to its
OWN step's `(pre, turn, post)`, so you cannot verify proof-of-turn-j against step-i. -/

attest a REORDERED 2-step chain. If the first step's `newRoot` differs from the second's `oldRoot`
(a spliced/reordered/dropped turn — the `TurnChainError::ChainBreak` condition), then for ANY engine
whose binding leaf verifies, `binding_sound` would force `ChainBound [s, s']`, which is FALSE for a
broken order. Hence the engine cannot have a verifying binding proof over a tampered chain — the
aggregate REJECTS reorder/drop/insert. -/

binds the head leaf `p` to the head step `s`: if `p` verifies, the executor ran `s`'s
`(pre, turn) ↦ post`. An adversary cannot satisfy the head leaf by supplying a proof of a DIFFERENT
turn while exporting `s`'s roots — the leaf is bound to `s` by the positional pairing, not re-pointable.
This is the recursion analog of the per-effect anti-ghost. -/

One subtlety to carry into Lean: the count lane is a field element, so the formal theorem either needs `leaves.length < p` or should model `count : Nat` and add a separate representation lemma for the field encoding. The Rust path already has the `< BabyBear modulus` admission check.

# Dregg2.Distributed.HistoryAggregation — the FOLD model under the IVC accumulator.

**What this is.** The whole-chain IVC accumulator (`circuit/src/ivc_turn_chain.rs`) folds a
sequence of finalized-turn proofs into ONE recursive proof attesting "all turns `1..K` executed
correctly AND the finalized state root advanced correctly from genesis to final, in that order."
This module is the EXECUTABLE/DECLARATIVE model that fold is supposed to attest — stated over the
VERIFIED executor (`Exec.RecordKernel.recCexec`, the same machine `BlocklaceFinality.executeTau`
drives) and the GENUINE per-turn state commitment (`Circuit.StateCommit.recStateCommit`, the
injective §8 full-state root the whole-turn triangle pins — `whole_turn_circuit_pins_intent_fold`).

It is the *meaning* of the chain. `RecursiveAggregation.lean` adds the SNARK recursion layer on top:
it names the inner-proof-soundness + recursive-verifier-soundness hypotheses (the part you cannot
prove in Lean — plonky3/pickles FRI), and shows that, UNDER those named hypotheses, an aggregate
proof's validity is exactly `AggregateAttests` from this file — so a light client that checks only
the succinct aggregate learns the whole history is correct.

**The two binding facts modeled here** (the `TurnChainBindingAir` of `ivc_turn_chain.rs:188`):
  1. **Per-step correctness** — each fold step `(pre, turn, post)` is a GENUINE `recCexec` step
     (its `commits` field), so the step proof, when sound, attests the verified executor actually
     ran that turn.
  2. **The temporal tooth** — `new_root[i] == old_root[i+1]` (`ivc_turn_chain.rs:246`): step `i`'s
     post-root is step `i+1`'s pre-root. Reorder / drop / insert ⇒ the chain breaks (UNSAT).

**The headline (`wellformed_attests_whole_history`):** a `WellFormedChain` from a genesis state
yields — for EVERY turn in the chain — a real `recCexec` step (the turn executed correctly per the
verified executor), the chain is correctly ordered (each post-root = next pre-root), and the whole
chain is a `Run recChainedSystem` from genesis whose final state is the genuine fold of the history,
so `recChained_run_conserves` (no mint/burn over the entire history) applies.

/-! ## 0. The §8 state-commitment portal (the genuine per-turn root).

`recStateCommit k t` is the injective full-state commitment from the whole-turn triangle — the ONE
authenticated per-turn state root the running prover folds (`StateCommit.lean:196`). It is
parametric in the Poseidon portal functions; we carry them as section variables exactly as
`StateCommit`/`WholeTurnTriangle` do, plus the single collision-resistance carrier
`compressInjective cmb` the binding lemma needs (REALIZABLE — Poseidon 2-to-1 CR). -/

/-! ## 1. One fold step — a finalized turn + the roots it advances.

The Rust `FinalizedTurn` (`ivc_turn_chain.rs:100`) carries a whole-turn proof whose PI exposes
`(OLD_COMMIT, NEW_COMMIT)`. Here a `ChainStep` carries the pre-state chained record, the turn, and
the post-state chained record, together with the EXECUTOR WITNESS `recCexec pre turn = some post` —
so this is a real verified step, not an asserted one. Its roots are the GENUINE `stateRoot` of the
pre/post kernels. -/

/-- A single fold step: a genuine `recCexec` transition `(pre, turn) ↦ post`, plus the receipt logs
the chained state carries. Modeled directly over the verified executor so the step's roots are the
real commitments of states the executor reached — what an honest inner step proof, when
sound, attests. -/

/-! ## 2. The temporal tooth — `new_root[i] == old_root[i+1]`.

`TurnChainBindingAir` constraint 1 (`ivc_turn_chain.rs:246`): each step's `new_root` must be the
NEXT step's `old_root`. A reordered/dropped/inserted turn breaks this and is UNSAT. -/

/-- **`Continues s s'`** — the temporal tooth between adjacent steps: `s.newRoot = s'.oldRoot`
(`new_root[i] == old_root[i+1]`). Its failure is the `TurnChainError::ChainBreak` rejection. -/

/-! ## 3. State-level continuity + the well-formed chain.

The Rust chain binding is over ROOTS; the executor model adds the underlying STATE continuity (step
`i`'s post-state IS step `i+1`'s pre-state — `RecChainedState` equality), which §5 shows the
root-level tooth recovers under CR. `lastStateOf` is the state the chain reaches from genesis. -/

/-! ## 4. The genuine final root of the whole history.

The accumulator's final claim is "`final_root` = the genuine fold of the whole history"
(`ivc_turn_chain.rs:18`): the §8 commitment of the kernel reached by folding `recCexec` over all the
turns. `lastStateOf g steps` IS that folded state; its commitment is the genuine final root. -/

/-- **`foldedFinalRoot g steps`** — the genuine §8 final root: commit the folded post-kernel
(`lastStateOf`) under the last step's turn-context (the `NEW_COMMIT` the accumulator exposes; the
empty chain commits genesis under `default`). -/

  | some s => stateRoot CH RH cmb compress compressN (lastStateOf g steps).kernel s.turn

/-! ## 5. The CR recovery — the ROOT tooth recovers STATE continuity.

The accumulator's verifier only sees ROOTS, not states. Under collision-resistance of the commitment
(`compressInjective cmb`, via `recStateCommit_binds`), the root-level tooth recovers the underlying
kernel continuity. This is why the LIGHT CLIENT, seeing only roots, learns state
continuity — the §8 root is an injective full-state commitment. -/

/-- **`seam_roots_chain` (the easy direction).** State-level continuity at a seam ENTAILS
the root-level tooth: if `s.post = s'.pre` and the turn-contexts agree at the seam, their roots
chain. So an honest accumulator never asserts the tooth separately — it is free from execution. -/
theorem seam_roots_chain (s s' : ChainStep)
    (hstate : s.post = s'.pre) (hturn : s.turn = s'.turn) :
    ChainStep.newRoot CH RH cmb compress compressN s
      = ChainStep.oldRoot CH RH cmb compress compressN s' := by
  unfold ChainStep.newRoot ChainStep.oldRoot
  rw [hstate, hturn]

/-- **`root_tooth_pins_state` (THE CR RECOVERY).** Under collision-resistance of the
commitment combiner, the ROOT-level tooth pins the underlying full-state COMMITMENT: if two steps
share a turn-context and their seam roots agree, then their cell-digests AND rest-hashes agree
(`cellDigest s.post = cellDigest s'.pre ∧ RH s.post = RH s'.pre`). That is exactly the binding
`recStateCommit_binds` provides — the §8 root is an injective commitment to (live-cell digest, rest
hash), i.e. to the WHOLE kernel (every cell binds via `cellLeafInjective`; the 16 non-cell fields via
`RestHashIffFrame`). So a light client that sees only the matching roots GENUINELY learns the states
chained, up to CR. This is the load-bearing fact that makes "verify the succinct aggregate"
sufficient: the root IS the full-state commitment. -/

          s.post.kernel s'.pre.kernel s'.turn htooth

/-- **`root_tooth_pins_kernel` (THE STRENGTHENED CR RECOVERY — state-equality, not just commitment).**
The critique's precise gap: `root_tooth_pins_state` recovers only `cellDigest`+`RH` EQUALITY
(commitment-level), not the `s.post.kernel = s'.pre.kernel` STATE equality `StateChained` needs — so
the headline still took state continuity as a separate prover hypothesis. This closes it: under the
FULL standard Poseidon CR set + the PROVED-preserved `AccountsWF` structural invariant on BOTH seam
kernels, an agreeing root-tooth at a matched turn-context forces the WHOLE kernel equal
(`recStateCommit_binds_kernel`: `RH` recovers the 15 non-cell fields incl. `accounts`, then the cell
digest recovers `cell` over the now-common carrier). So a light client seeing only the matching roots
GENUINELY learns the adjacent KERNELS coincide — up to CR — not merely their commitments. (The
receipt LOG is the one `RecChainedState` component the §8 state root does NOT bind; see
`KernelChained` below — conservation rides on the kernel alone, so the log is conservation-irrelevant,
and that is the exact, named residual rather than a hidden hypothesis.) -/

But the digest deviation (base-field fold instead of codex's specified collision-resistant commitment) is a REAL soundness downgrade for same-endpoint/same-count histories — and it's ALGEBRAICALLY broken, not merely 31-bit.
metatheory/docs/CODEX-IVC-REVIEW-3.md:5:**Verdict: partial close.** The original mixed-root forgery with different genesis/final/count is closed in the K-fold path.

So if A and B differ in genesis, final, or count, the rejection does not depend on the digest.

metatheory/docs/CODEX-IVC-REVIEW-3.md:27:**Bottom line:** distinct-endpoint mixed-root forgery is genuinely rejected. Full ordered-history soundness is not achieved. Same-endpoint/same-count histories rely on a one-felt, algebraically weak digest; if an attacker can realize colliding intermediate roots as valid executions, a proof of A can stand in for B’s middle history. The fix should replace `seg_hash2_*` with an in-circuit collision-resistant multi-felt commitment, and the root claim should carry that wider digest.

metatheory/docs/CODEX-IVC-REVIEW-3.md:1:# Codex re-review #3 — the segment-accumulator close + the weak-digest deviation (2026-06-24)
metatheory/docs/CODEX-IVC-REVIEW-3.md:3:VERDICT: PARTIAL CLOSE. Distinct-endpoint mixed-root forgery genuinely REJECTED (structural). But the digest deviation (base-field fold instead of codex's specified collision-resistant commitment) is a REAL soundness downgrade for same-endpoint/same-count histories — and it's ALGEBRAICALLY broken, not merely 31-bit.
metatheory/docs/CODEX-IVC-REVIEW-3.md:5:**Verdict: partial close.** The original mixed-root forgery with different genesis/final/count is closed in the K-fold path. The root proof exposes the descriptor-derived segment, and the verifier compares it to the carried claim at [ivc_turn_chain.rs:1757](/Users/ember/dev/breadstuffs/circuit-prove/src/ivc_turn_chain.rs:1757). So if A and B differ in genesis, final, or count, the rejection does not depend on the digest.
metatheory/docs/CODEX-IVC-REVIEW-3.md:22:   [accumulator.rs:39](/Users/ember/dev/breadstuffs/circuit-prove/src/accumulator.rs:39) explicitly says the online accumulator still uses a separate binding leaf and retains the mixed-root structural weakness. Scope the close to the balanced K-fold path only.
metatheory/docs/CODEX-IVC-REVIEW-3.md:27:**Bottom line:** distinct-endpoint mixed-root forgery is genuinely rejected. Full ordered-history soundness is not achieved. Same-endpoint/same-count histories rely on a one-felt, algebraically weak digest; if an attacker can realize colliding intermediate roots as valid executions, a proof of A can stand in for B’s middle history. The fix should replace `seg_hash2_*` with an in-circuit collision-resistant multi-felt commitment, and the root claim should carry that wider digest.

/-! ## 7. THE UNBOUNDED IVC ACCUMULATOR — the running left-fold, proven by induction from genesis.

§§1–6 prove the FLAT statement: given a `WholeChainProof` over a *finite* K-turn window, verifying its
root attests `WellFormedChain` for that window. That is the BOUNDED-K light client (`ivc_turn_chain.rs::
prove_turn_chain_recursive`, a balanced binary tree over K leaves).

This section proves the part Mina LACKS: that the accumulator can be driven as a CONTINUOUS LEFT-FOLD
(`acc_n = accumulate(acc_{n-1}, turn_n)`), extending the attested history ONE step at a time, with O(1)
memory (keep only `acc_{n-1}`), and that the running accumulator's attestation is PRESERVED at every
step — so by induction from genesis, `acc_n` attests the WHOLE history `0..n`. This is the IVC soundness
INDUCTION as a Lean theorem:

  `accumulate_preserves_wellformed` — IF `acc` attests `WellFormedChain g steps` AND the next turn `s`
  is executor-sound (a `ChainStep`, so `s.commits` is built in) and STATE-EXTENDS the head
  (`s.pre = lastStateOf g steps`), THEN `accumulate acc s` attests `WellFormedChain g (steps ++ [s])`.

  `acc_attests_whole_history` — folding `accumulate` from the genesis accumulator over a state-extending
  stream yields an accumulator attesting `WellFormedChain g (the whole stream)`. The base case is the
  empty chain (trivially well-formed); the step is `accumulate_preserves_wellformed`.

This is the SOUNDNESS SKELETON of the unbounded online accumulator. The CRYPTO carrier (the running
recursion proof re-verified in-circuit so `acc_n.proof` has the SAME shape `acc_{n+1}` can verify — the
IVC fixed point) is the SAME named, realizable `EngineSound` boundary §2 already carries; nothing new is
axiomatized. What this section adds OVER §§1–6 is the INDUCTIVE characterization: the flat headline is
re-derived as the n-th unfolding of a one-step-at-a-time fold from genesis.

NOTE on the seam (the genuinely-load-bearing hypothesis, named not hidden). `accumulate` extends a chain
at its HEAD; for the *root-level* temporal tooth (`ChainBound`) to extend, the new step's `oldRoot` must
equal the previous last step's `newRoot`. We DERIVE that from state continuity (`s.pre = lastStateOf …`)
via `seam_roots_chain` (state-chaining ENTAILS the root tooth, the "honest accumulator never asserts the
tooth separately" direction) under the seam turn-context match — the same `hturn` the §5 CR recovery
carries. State continuity is the producer's witness (exactly as `StateChained` is everywhere here); the
tooth is then FREE, not a second assumption. -/

/-! ### Snoc lemmas — extending each chain predicate by one step at the TAIL.

`accumulate` appends `s` at the END (`steps ++ [s]`). The chain predicates (`StateChained`, `ChainBound`,
`lastStateOf`) are defined by recursion on the HEAD, so extending at the tail needs these three snoc
lemmas, each a straightforward list induction. They are the load-bearing combinatorial content of the
IVC step: dropping/reordering at the tail would break exactly one of them. -/

/-! ### `accumulate` — the IVC step (extend one leaf at a time). -/

/-- **`accumulate acc s hseam hturn`** — the running left-fold step. Given the running accumulator
`acc` (attesting `WellFormedChain g acc.steps`) and the next executor-sound turn `s` (a `ChainStep`, so
`s.commits` is built in) that STATE-EXTENDS the head (`hseam : s.pre = acc.head`) under a matched seam
turn-context (`hturn`), produce `acc'` attesting `WellFormedChain g (acc.steps ++ [s])`. O(1) view: the
prover keeps only `acc` (its running proof); `acc.steps` is the SPEC the proof attests, extended by one.

The two invariants are re-established by the snoc lemmas:
  * STATE continuity (`stateChained_snoc`) from `hseam`;
  * the ROOT temporal tooth (`chainBound_snoc`) — and the NEW seam `Continues last s` is DERIVED from
    `hseam` (state continuity) via `seam_roots_chain`, so the tooth is FREE, never a second assumption. -/

accumulator attests the WHOLE history it has folded: `acc.leanWitness` IS a `WellFormedChain` from
genesis over `acc.steps`, for ANY accumulator reachable from `genesisAcc` by `accumulate` steps. We
state it as: every `Acc` (which can only be built by `genesisAcc` + `accumulate`, both of which
maintain the invariant) carries the whole-history attestation in its `leanWitness`. Composed with
`light_client_verifies_whole_history` (§3) — whose `EngineSound` is sound for exactly this
`WellFormedChain` — a light client verifying the running root learns the whole accumulated history is
correct, ordered, and genuinely folded. This is the unbounded IVC soundness, by induction from genesis,

/-! ### IVC non-vacuity — the accumulator FIRES on a real chain (genesis → one accumulate step).

The induction would be hollow if no real `accumulate` step could fire. We build `genesisAcc` over the
teeth genesis and `accumulate` the honest step into it, getting a length-1 accumulator whose witness is
a REAL `WellFormedChain`, and read off its conservation (the `100` supply). So the IVC step is inhabited
on a genuine executor run, not an empty implication. -/

(b) the **sorted `cap-membership` leg** ("cap Phase D", `:1075-1100`, witness `CapMembershipWitness` `:212` ← `ConsumedCapWitness`, `prove_cap_membership_p3` over the SORTED `CanonicalCapTree`, directional path, vk `cap_membership_circuit_descriptor`, expectation `CapMembershipExpectation` `:239` pins `pi[CAP_ROOT]` to the trusted root `:248`) proves "the SPECIFIC CONSUMED capability's full 7-field leaf preimage opens against THE holder's real sorted `cap_root` tree" — the authority leg that ties the acting/consumed cap to the authenticated cap-state, with sorted single-leaf-per-slot semantics. **The two are not redundant:** the sorted leg gives the strictly stronger, structurally-pinned, typed-leaf guarantee; the 4-ary leg gives a weaker generic membership over an unpinned root with an opaque leaf. **Retire-vs-keep tradeoff:** for a cap-gated turn the sorted `cap-membership` leg SUBSUMES the authority claim the 4-ary leg makes (consumed-cap-in-the-real-cap_root ⊃ opaque-leaf-in-some-4-ary-tree), so the 4-ary leg is retireable FOR CAP-GATED TURNS on the claim alone. **Live-producer evidence (the deciding fact):** there is currently NO live producer that sets `membership: Some(MembershipWitness{..})` — the only two build sites (`full_turn_proof.rs:2303`, `:2774`) are both inside `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` (`:2107`) using `merkle_test_witness`; the only LIVE membership-leg producer is `cap_membership` (`node/src/turn_proving.rs:518`, `CapMembershipWitness::from_consumed`). So today the 4-ary `membership` leg is dead on the live path — its `Option`/`P3MerklePoseidon2Air`/`merkle_poseidon2_descriptor` plumbing is wired + SDK-tested but unfed. **The keep argument** is therefore forward-looking, not current: the 4-ary leg is the GENERIC credential/c-list membership primitive (opaque leaf, witnessed root, no sorted `cap_root` to open against) that a NON-cap predicate-credential turn-shape WOULD use — retiring it removes that future affordance and the `merkle_poseidon2` descriptor's only full-turn consumer. **Recommendation (ember to ratify):** keep the 4-ary leg as the general-membership primitive but DO NOT couple it to cap-gated turns (the sorted leg is the cap authority leg of record); OR, if no near-term non-cap credential turn-shape is planned, demote the 4-ary leg + its descriptor to a clearly-labelled "general membership, no live producer" status (Research tier) so it stops reading as a live cap-authority alternative. Before any removal, confirm no in-flight feature wires a live `membership: Some(..)`. Named: cap-crown #103 Phase-D map, 2026-06-13. (Left intact — characterization only, per the brief.)

# Codex FINAL re-review — IVC #1 same-endpoint close (2026-06-25): NO CRITICAL HOLE

VERDICT: for the K-fold segment path, NO critical soundness hole — the same-endpoint mixed-root forgery is GENUINELY CLOSED under the Poseidon2 truncated-output commitment assumption.

## Why sound
- Bug A (dropped v_j==0): NOT reopened. expose_claim reads the FULL ext tuple [idx,c0,c1,c2,c3] on the WitnessChecks bus (bus-bound to the W24 output, so c1/c2/c3 can't be freely chosen), exposes only c0 as the public. A forgery requires a collision in the exposed digest.
- THE DIGEST IS NOT ~31-bit coeff-0-only: dregg compares a 7-felt segment claim — genesis, final, count, + FOUR BabyBear digest lanes (ivc_turn_chain.rs:224 + :1963). ~124-bit digest collision resistance.
- Bug B (off-bus capacity): AIR-constrained (noncompact Poseidon2 AIR ties absent next-row inputs to the prior row output; executor mirrors). Sound.

## Residuals (codex, NONE critical)
- MEDIUM (scope): the ONLINE ACCUMULATOR path (accumulator.rs:171/819/916) is still single-felt/zero-padded, explicitly scoped out — do NOT generalize the K-fold close to it. The named separate follow-up.
- LOW (doc drift): comments at expose_claim_air.rs:23 + circuit_builder.rs:486 still describe the old scalar-only expose — fix them (they now contradict the soundness-critical design).
- LOW (margin): the checked digest is 4 BabyBear lanes (~124 bit), not the full D-coeff tuple. Avoids the old one-felt hole; widening beyond 4 lanes would give a conservative 128-bit story.

Do it as a theorem over the **aggregation proof tree**, not over an `Acc`/witness record.

For same endpoints/count, the final “B’s history differs from A’s history” step needs the Poseidon2 binding assumption:

```lean
PoseidonSegBinding :
  treeDigest leavesA = treeDigest leavesB ->
  same ordered leaf segments leavesA leavesB
```

Without that, Lean can prove “the carried claim equals the genuine segment summary of A’s executed leaves”; it cannot prove “no different B exists with the same segment” except by reducing it to a Poseidon2 collision. That is the right boundary: EngineSound gives local proof/constraint soundness; the induction gives ordered-chain binding; Poseidon2 CR gives semantic uniqueness of the ordered digest.
