Generator for the FRI arity-2 fold-consistency template + its honest witness,
consumed by the Go emit-path replayer (chain/gnark/emitted_verifier_full.go
block 1: the `FriFoldRowArity2` case -> friFoldReplay -> ReplayTemplateWithWitness).

It renders the Lean-authored, ∀-refined `friFoldData s0 s1 β claimed bits`
(FriFoldEmit.lean -- `friFold_leaf_refines`: `gHolds (friFoldData …) (friFoldAsg …)
↔ foldCheckV … = true`, the deployed `friFoldCoreRef` fold `(e0+e1)/2 +
β·(e0−e1)·inv(2s)`) through the proof-covered `emitGnarkJson` renderer to the
committed `fri_fold_template.json` grammar the generic replayer reads, AND dumps
the Lean-generated honest assignment (`St.assigns`, var-index-ordered) to
`fri_fold_witness.json` -- the same object `friFold_leaf_refines` quantifies over.

The fixture is the apex-shrink round-0 fold: β = the real fixture
`expected_betas[0]` (chain/gnark/fixtures/apex_shrink_fri_real.json), and
`apexShrinkShape.logGlobalMaxHeight − 1` parent bits — DERIVED from the shape, not
typed, because the Go replayer refuses a query whose parent-bit count exceeds the
template's and a re-mint moves it. The siblings + claimed are a
self-consistent honest fold (`claimed := foldCoreV s0 s1 β (invSV bits)`), so the
emitted R1CS is satisfiable by the dumped witness. The round-0 fold-beta operand
the transcript link binds (block1FoldBeta) is a SEPARATE flat-bank carrier; this
replay exercises the Lean-authored fold ARITHMETIC as real R1CS in place of the
hand-Go ExtMul cost chain.

This is NOT part of `lake build` (it lives under scripts/, outside the globbed
libs). Regenerate with, from the metatheory/ directory:

    lake env lean --run scripts/gen_fri_fold_template.lean
