# Market.ProtocolAssurance — the honest STARK ↔ Market ↔ settlement seam.

`Dregg2.Circuit.CircuitSoundness` and the Market tower were previously imported by the same root file,
but no theorem connected them.  In particular, an accepted batch exposed only
`(effect, pre, post, turn)`, while `DrexClearing` was handed directly to `settleDrex`; neither the STARK
extractor nor a modeled settlement-proof verifier produced that clearing.

This module makes the seam explicit without inventing it:

* `MarketBoundaryBinding` is the smallest faithful endpoint relation: the accepted batch's public roots
  are exactly the commitments of a real `DrexClearing`.  Commitment binding then forces the decoded
  STARK endpoints to be that clearing's endpoints.
* `MarketEffectStepExtractsClearing` is the maximally narrow endpoint fact: the kernel endpoints of a
  step extracted for the designated effect are realized by a proof-carrying clearing.  The ordinary
  STARK extraction, witness decode, and commitment binding are no longer hidden in a second accept-level
  hypothesis; the theorems below invoke `lightclient_unfoolable` themselves.
* The exact clearing-allocation lowering is now proved by `drexClearing_refines_turnSpec`.  The former
  proposal to recover that two-leg allocation from tag zero's single `dispatchArm` is refuted by
  `not_marketEffectApexLiftResidual_balance`: their receipt-log arities differ.  The direct ring
  descriptor must retain/extract the fused ring and its endpoints instead.
* `starkMarketClaimExtraction_of_effect_step`, `lightclient_market_seam`, and
  `accepted_market_settles_on_same_commitment_surface` prove everything above that exact descriptor
  fact: the decoded STARK transition is the fair, kernel-real clearing; it conserves every asset; and
  the cross-chain register advances from the same pre-commitment to the same post-commitment.
* `SettlementVerifier25Refines` names the second missing theorem over the exact canonical 25-lane ABI.
  The current `settleDrex` consumes a pre-proved `DrexClearing` and models only continuity plus register
  update.  Groth16 soundness must imply existence of the clearing whose eight-lane roots and turn count
  it accepted; the byte packing below is no longer generic prose.

The repaired cross-chain witness is also shown to satisfy `AccountsWF`, the structural invariant
required by `StateDecode`.  Previously its `cell` function was non-default outside `{1,2}`, so the
Market demo could not inhabit the light-client boundary at all.

At HEAD the single-effect dispatcher has no `DrexClearing` constructor: a clearing contains at least
two settlement legs, while `BatchPublicInputs.effect` selects one `FullActionA`.  The direct ring-
descriptor route below has the right theorem shape, but the current six-lane note apex omits creators,
kernel endpoints, turn count, and receipt-chain output.  Therefore only that endpoint-carrying
descriptor/whole-turn extraction remains named; it cannot be manufactured from the note claim.

Pure.  No axioms; the two missing links remain named propositions.

/-! ## 1a. The concrete settlement-list lowering.

There is one important guard distinction at this seam.  `settleRing` folds the kernel-only
`recKExecAsset`, whereas the ordinary `.balanceA` action uses `recCexecAsset`: the latter additionally
requires the destination to be Live and prepends the movement receipt to `RecChainedState.log`.
Consequently the standalone implication from a raw kernel step to `BalanceMovementSpec` is false
without the destination-liveness premise.  A successfully settled *cycle* supplies that premise:
every receiver is another leg's sender, and every successfully executing sender is Live.  The lemmas
below make those two facts explicit and then perform the exact fold, including the receipt log. -/

/-- The receipt-chain suffix produced by executing a ring left-to-right.  Each action prepends its
receipt, so the final log contains the ring's turns in reverse execution order before the old log. -/

/-- The ordinary full-action lowering of a kernel ring. -/

  r.map fun l => .balanceA l.toTurn l.asset

/-- A committed raw per-asset step forces its source lifecycle to be Live.  This is the seventh
conjunct of `recKExecAsset`'s real acceptance guard, retained here because the older public
`recKExecAsset_committed` projection deliberately exposes only its first six conjuncts. -/

/-- **The maximal endpoint-level fragment at the current apex.**  The designated single effect's

the facts needed by `settleRing_refines_turnSpec`: `CycleValid` plus positive wants make its settlement
ring `RingBalanced`, and `c.settled` is the real kernel fold.  Thus its exact allocation lowers to the
ordinary action list, including the uniquely determined receipt-chain post-state. -/

/-! ### ⚰ TOMBSTONE — `ShieldedRingDescriptorRefines` / `ShieldedRingApexRefinementResidual`
(DELETED 2026-08-02).

**What it claimed.** For a `CommitSurface` `S`, a hash and a descriptor `d`:

    Poseidon2SpongeCR hash →
    ∀ minit mfin maddrs t pc pre post,
      Satisfied2 hash d minit mfin maddrs t → tracePublishedCommit t = pc →
      StateDecode S pc pre post → ShieldedRingApexStep pre post

— "any satisfying witness of the shielded-ring descriptor whose own publication decodes to `pre`/`post`
yields the whole fused, fair, kernel-real two-leg clearing AND its receipt-chain link". The alias
`ShieldedRingApexRefinementResidual` was the same proposition under the name the shielded apex advertised
as its last piece of honest work.

**Why it was vacuous.** The `Poseidon2SpongeCR hash →` antecedent sat in the VALUE, and
`HashFloorHonesty.poseidon2SpongeCR_false_babyBear` PROVES IT FALSE at deployed BabyBear (infinite
`List Int` into ~2³¹ values, pigeonhole). `DescriptorRefinesShirkRefuted.descriptorRefines_vacuous_babyBear`
transfers verbatim: at any field-bounded sponge the def held for EVERY descriptor, including with
`ShieldedRingApexStep` replaced by anything at all. Because the floor was in the value and not the
signature, no floor binder appeared in the type of anything that mentioned it and `#floor_ratchet` — which
keys on binders — saw nothing at the consumers. Nothing in the tree ever discharged it.

**Why the antecedent was not simply deleted.** `shieldedRingDescriptorRefinesFree_forces_no_decode`
(below, §"THE FLOOR-FREE SHIELDED RUNG") proves the antecedent-free port holds only where its own premise
is EMPTY: `StateDecode`/`StateDecodeC` are LOG-BLIND while `ShieldedRingApexStep` is LOG-FORCING, so the
forged pair `(pre, ⟨post.kernel, pre.log⟩)` decodes the same commitment and yields
`pre.log.length = pre.log.length + 2`. Deleting the antecedent would have traded a free hypothesis for an
unsatisfiable one.

**What replaced it.** `ShieldedRingDescriptorRefinesKernel` — no floor, bundle replaced by a bare
`ApexFloorFree.CommitMap`, publication link kept, conclusion weakened to `ShieldedRingApexKernelStep` (the
fused fair kernel-real clearing at the two states' KERNELS). Both poles live:
`shieldedRingApexKernelStep_realizable` and `shieldedRingDescriptorRefinesKernel_refutable` (refuted on
KERNEL content at `ApexFloorFree.collapseMap emptyTrace`, via `settleRing_preserves_nullifiers`).

**What the caller now discharges.** The receipt-chain half is no longer asserted; it is
`ShieldedRingLogResidual f pre post` — one equation, zero quantifiers, naming the decoded pair AND the
extracted clearing — carried as an implication ON THAT INSTANCE at every consumer.
`shieldedRingLogResidual_unconditional_false` proves dropping it makes the decomposition FALSE, so it is
work and not decoration. Consumers, all in this file:
`shieldedRingKernelEndpoints_of_accept` (was `shieldedRingApexStep_of_accept`),
`starkMarketClaimExtraction_of_shielded_descriptor` (statement UNCHANGED — its conclusion
`MarketBoundaryBinding` reads kernels only and never needed the log half; the old proof already discarded
it), and `lightclient_market_seam_of_shielded_descriptor` (its `ShieldedRingApexStep` and `turnSpec`
conjuncts moved behind the residual implication).

⚠ Their `hCR : Poseidon2SpongeCR hash` binders went with it: `hCR` was consumed ONLY to discharge this
def's dead antecedent, so the three consumers now bind no floor at all. Their
`Dregg2/Verify/FloorRatchetBaseline.lean` rows, and the two rows naming this def and its alias, are
SLACK — that file is emitted as `baseline ∩ current` and never errors on a name that is no longer a
carrier. They are deliberately left in place.

Do NOT resurrect this shape. Do NOT re-ground on `SpongeCollisionShirk.SpongeColl` at a named pair (no
proof here feeds the sponge a pair, so a per-instance side condition would be decoration and a fresh
carrier), and do NOT re-ground on `OrBreak (SpongeCollision hash) _` — refuted wholesale by
`SpongeCollisionShirk.bareDisjunction_is_not_a_regrounding`. -/

⚰ The def this section measures — `ShieldedRingDescriptorRefines` — was DELETED on 2026-08-02; see the
tombstone above. Everything below is retained because it is what MEASURED that def, and the measurement
is the reason the retirement took the shape it did. Read it in the past tense.

`ShieldedRingDescriptorRefines` carried `Poseidon2SpongeCR hash →` in its VALUE, so no floor binder
appeared in the type of anything that mentioned it. The annotation above prescribed the repair that
landed for `ClosureAll.ClosedLogExtract` and `CircuitCompleteness.descriptorComplete`: DELETE the
antecedent and restate over a bare commit map. This section lands the target of that port and then
MEASURES it — and the measurement says the deletion, taken alone, does not repair that def.

**The ported rung needs no new obligation shape.** With `StateDecode S` replaced by its field-for-field
commit-map twin `ApexFloorFree.StateDecodeC C`, the body of `ShieldedRingDescriptorRefines` IS
`ApexFloorFree.descriptorRefinesFree C hash d ShieldedRingApexStep` — the same universally quantified
rung the apex chain already runs on, at the shielded step relation. So the port routes through an
existing floor-free bridge rather than minting a second one, and
`ShieldedRingDescriptorRefinesFree` below is an `abbrev`, not a new `Prop`.

⚑⚑ **AND THE PORTED RUNG HAS NO SATISFIABLE POLE WITH CIRCUIT CONTENT** —
`shieldedRingDescriptorRefinesFree_forces_no_decode`, proved below. The reason is structural and has
nothing to do with the sponge:

  * `StateDecode` / `StateDecodeC` are LOG-BLIND. All four fields read `pre.kernel` and `post.kernel`
    (`preBinds`, `postBinds`, `preWF`, `postWF`); `RecChainedState.log` appears in none of them.
  * `ShieldedRingApexStep` is LOG-FORCING: its third conjunct is
    `post.log = ringReceiptLog (settlementsOf f.clearing.nodes) pre.log`, and with `f.twoLeg` that
    gives `ShieldedRingApexStep.log_length : post.log.length = pre.log.length + 2`.

So from ANY decode `StateDecodeC C pc pre post` one builds a SECOND decode of the SAME `pc` — the pair
`(pre, ⟨post.kernel, pre.log⟩)`, which agrees with the first on every field the decode reads — and the
rung applied there yields `pre.log.length = pre.log.length + 2`. The rung therefore holds only where its
own premise is EMPTY. Deleting the antecedent trades an obligation the PARAMETERS discharge for one no
circuit can discharge; the three consumers would go from "free hypothesis" to "unsatisfiable hypothesis
⟹ anything", which is the failure `ApexFloorFree`'s satisfiable poles exist to rule out.

⚠ **THIS IS A PROPERTY OF THE CLASS, NOT OF THE SHIELDED RING.** Every per-effect spec ends
`st'.log = t :: st.log` (`BalanceMovementSpec`, `MintASpec`, `BalanceMovementSpecFacet`, …), so
`dispatchArm` and `dispatchArmFacetTB` are log-forcing in exactly the same way. What differs is where
the log link is supplied. `CircuitSoundness.descriptorRefines` is PARAMETRIC in `kstep`, so it keeps a
satisfiable pole (`ApexFloorFree.descriptorRefinesFree_trivial`), and its deployed discharge
`ClosureAll.hrefinesAllClosed` carries the link EXPLICITLY as `mkLog`, a producer of
`ClosureLog.StateDecodeLog` — a `FloorRatchet.sentinelBundles` member carrying `logHashInjective`.
`ShieldedRingDescriptorRefines` bakes `ShieldedRingApexStep` in and carries no such link, so there is
nowhere for it to arrive except a new hypothesis. Supplying it the way the tree already does
reintroduces a refuted floor; supplying it honestly means either weakening the conclusion to its
kernel-endpoint half or naming a per-instance log residual. That decision is the NEXT step and is
deliberately not taken here.

⚑ **CORRECTION — IT IS TAKEN IN THE NEXT SECTION, AND IT IS ONE MOVE, NOT TWO.** "Weaken the conclusion
to its kernel-endpoint half" and "name a per-instance log residual" read above as alternatives; they are
the two halves of one decomposition, and the section below lands both together
(`ShieldedRingDescriptorRefinesKernel` + `ShieldedRingLogResidual`, reassembled by
`shieldedRingApexStep_of_kernelEndpoints_and_residual`). ⚑ AND THE REWIRING IS NOW DONE TOO (2026-08-02):
all three consumers take the kernel rung, the old def and its alias are deleted, and the log clause
travels as an explicit `ShieldedRingLogResidual` implication wherever it was load-bearing. See the
tombstone above.

⚠ `descriptorRefinesTB` was the same shape and WORSE: it carried no `tracePublishedCommit t = pc`
link at all, so its `pc` was unconstrained. The correction above applied verbatim to its annotation —
⚑ AND THE "WORSE" WAS MEASURED, not just asserted:
`RotatedKernelRefinementFacetTurnBound.descriptorRefinesTBKernelUnlinked_forces_no_decode` proves that
without the link even the kernel-endpoint half holds only where its own premise is empty, for a reason
that has nothing to do with the log (a decode is two equations in `pc.turn`, so it survives moving `pc`
to any turn, including a self-transfer the admit guard refuses). The kernel-endpoint repair therefore
transferred to that def ONLY with the publication link restored — `descriptorRefinesTBKernelFree`, §8
there, which is what its apex now takes; that def, like this one, was RETIRED on 2026-08-02 (⚰ tombstone
at §6 of that file).

/-- ⚑⚑ **THE MEASUREMENT: the ported rung ENTAILS THAT NOTHING DECODES.** At every commit map, hash and
descriptor, if the floor-free shielded rung holds then NO pair of chained states decodes the commitment
the empty trace publishes. The rung is not merely hard to discharge — it is FALSE wherever its own
premise fires, so it has no satisfiable pole carrying circuit content.

The proof is the log-blindness argument stated above and uses nothing about the hash: from the given
decode of `pre`/`post`, the pair `(pre, ⟨post.kernel, pre.log⟩)` decodes the SAME commitment (the decode
reads only kernels and their well-formedness), and `ShieldedRingApexStep.log_length` at that pair gives
`pre.log.length = pre.log.length + 2`.

⚠ This is why "delete the antecedent" is NOT by itself the port for this def, and it is the reason the
three `hmarket` consumers are NOT rewired in this commit. -/

/-! ## ⚑ THE SOUND HALF OF THE SHIELDED RUNG — kernel endpoints proved, the log clause NAMED.

The section above measured that `ShieldedRingDescriptorRefinesFree` — the antecedent-deleted port of
`ShieldedRingDescriptorRefines` — holds only where its own premise is EMPTY
(`shieldedRingDescriptorRefinesFree_forces_no_decode`), and left the repair open with two named
alternatives: weaken the conclusion to its kernel-endpoint half and name the log clause as a separate
per-instance residual, or carry the log link as an explicit non-crypto premise. This section lands the
FIRST. ⚑ It landed additively on 2026-08-02 and was WIRED IN the same day — the three consumers below
now take this rung and the old def is deleted (⚰ tombstone, §"The exact remaining descriptor refinement").

**Why the kernel-endpoint half survives the argument that killed the whole one.** The refutation
manufactures a SECOND decode of the same commitment — `(pre, ⟨post.kernel, pre.log⟩)` — which agrees
with the given one on every field `StateDecodeC` reads. That collapse is fatal only to a conclusion
that reads `.log`. `ShieldedRingApexKernelStep` reads neither endpoint's log:
`shieldedRingApexKernelStep_log_blind` is `Iff.rfl`, i.e. the collapse is not merely survivable, it is
INVISIBLE to the conclusion. The full step is FALSE at every collapsed pair
(`not_shieldedRingApexStep_log_collapse`, at every `pre`/`post` whatsoever) — that theorem IS the engine
of `shieldedRingDescriptorRefinesFree_forces_no_decode`, and it has no analogue one rung down.

**The residual is per-instance and quantifier-free.** `ShieldedRingLogResidual f pre post` is the single
equation `post.log = ringReceiptLog (settlementsOf f.clearing.nodes) pre.log`. It names the pair AND the
extracted clearing; it quantifies over nothing. It is therefore neither a universally quantified side
condition (which would be `logHashInjective` rewritten) nor a disjunct with a global existential (free —
`SpongeCollisionShirk.orBreak_spongeCollision_iff_True`). The apex below carries it in exactly that
position: the residual appears as an implication ON THE PAIR AND CLEARING BOUND BY THE EXISTENTIAL, so a
consumer that discharges it for its own decoded instance recovers the full `ShieldedRingApexStep` and one
that cannot still keeps the kernel endpoints.

⚑ **THE RETIREMENT, LANDED 2026-08-02 — what the shielded apex ADVERTISES CHANGED, and here is how.**
The old def and its alias are DELETED (⚰ tombstone at their former definition site). What each consumer
now says, and where the log clause went:

  * `shieldedRingKernelEndpoints_of_accept` — RENAMED from `shieldedRingApexStep_of_accept`, because the
    old name promised `ShieldedRingApexStep` from an accept and that is no longer what it delivers
    unconditionally. It now exports the decode, the fused clearing, its two kernel-endpoint equations,
    AND `ShieldedRingLogResidual f pre post → ShieldedRingApexStep pre post` on the named instance. Its
    `hCR` binder is GONE: `hCR` was consumed only to discharge the deleted antecedent.
  * `starkMarketClaimExtraction_of_shielded_descriptor` — STATEMENT UNCHANGED but for the binders. Its
    conclusion `MarketBoundaryBinding` is three kernel/commitment facts and reads no `.log` at all; the
    old proof already discarded the log conjunct as `_hlog`. This consumer never needed the log half, so
    no residual travels here — the kernel rung alone reproves it verbatim.
  * `lightclient_market_seam_of_shielded_descriptor` — `MarketBoundaryBinding`, the decode, the endpoint
    equations and the asset-conservation clause survive UNCONDITIONALLY; the two conjuncts that read the
    receipt chain (`ShieldedRingApexStep` and the `turnSpec` allocation lowering, which is derived from
    it through `drexClearing_refines_turnSpec`) moved BEHIND the residual implication on the same bound
    instance.

The `Dregg2/Verify/FloorRatchetBaseline.lean` rows naming the deleted def, its alias and the three
consumers' `hCR` binders are now SLACK — that file is emitted as `baseline ∩ current`, so a baseline name
that is no longer a carrier is simply absent from `current` and never errors. They are left in place.

This is stated because of what it is placed against. `StateDecodeC` is log-blind in exactly this sense,
which is why `shieldedRingDescriptorRefinesFree_forces_no_decode` can feed the rung a second, forged pair
`(pre, ⟨post.kernel, pre.log⟩)` and extract `False` from the log-forcing conclusion. Against THIS
conclusion the same move yields nothing: the forged pair satisfies it exactly when the real one does. -/

false — for EVERY `pre` and `post`, at no hypothesis. `ShieldedRingApexStep.log_length` demands
`post.log.length = pre.log.length + 2`, and the collapsed pair's post log IS `pre.log`.

Read with `shieldedRingApexKernelStep_log_blind`, this is the exact boundary between the half that
survives and the half that does not: the same forged pair is invisible to the kernel-endpoint conclusion

/-- **`DrexClearingEffectRefinementResidual` (OPEN):** the missing per-effect/whole-turn descriptor
theorem.  Besides matching kernel endpoints, the extracted step must denote the exact list of ordinary
balance effects lowered from `c.nodes`; thus the allocation, not merely its final roots, is retained.

A faithful implementation can discharge this by adding a genuine clearing action whose descriptor
carries the allocation, or by lifting the apex to the emitted effect list.  At HEAD a public input names
one `FullActionA`, so this statement is named and not fabricated.

TRIAGE (2026-07-15, `assurance-audit`): the fair allocation is NOT trusted — it is CIRCUIT-ENFORCED. The
then-deployed, now-retired `shielded_ring_clearing_air.rs` bound each leg's cleared offer to a spent member
note by an in-circuit `connect` (forged leg ⇒ UNSAT), enforces the matching descriptor, nullifier
distinctness, and BOTH coordinate + range-checked INTEGER conservation; and `LedgerRealizationExt.
shielded_ring_fused_clears` proves the `CycleValid`+`LegFused` ring that settles via `settleRing` is
conserving + `RingBalanced`-fair + fused.

The LOWERING is now CLOSED by `drexClearing_refines_turnSpec`.  The raw per-leg implication originally
suggested here was slightly too weak: `recKExecAsset` omits the chained destination-liveness gate and
receipt append.  `recKExecAsset_refines_balanceMovement` states the exact step; cycle closure plus whole-
ring success derive destination liveness, and `settleRing_refines_turnSpec` performs the fold with the
exact reverse-prepended receipt log.

The viable remaining bridge is the DIRECT APEX-LIFT: the verifying ring descriptor must extract the
whole `CycleValid`+`LegFused` ring and its kernel endpoints.  It cannot pass through one `FullActionA`:
`not_marketEffectApexLiftResidual_balance` proves the tag-zero route inconsistent with the two-receipt
ring transition.  The current Rust-authored
`shielded-ring-clear-2` leaf cannot discharge that proposition: its public claim is exactly the six
note lanes `[nf₀,root₀,vb₀,nf₁,root₁,vb₁]`; neither creator, eight-lane kernel pre/post commitments,
turn count, authorization/lifecycle state, nor receipt-chain output is present.  It proves the hidden-
note fusion/cycle/conservation algebra, but not an executor transition.  Closure therefore requires a
Lean-authored endpoint-carrying outer descriptor (architectural law #1), binding these note rows to the
two ordinary balance actions and the batch's decoded pre/post commitment surface. -/

/-! ### The direct shielded-descriptor route.

The generic single-action `dispatchArm` is not needed once the market registry entry itself refines to
the shielded ring.  This is the faithful apex shape for a ring descriptor: STARK extraction gives
its satisfying trace, state decode gives the committed endpoints, and the descriptor theorem gives the
fused clearing and its kernel endpoints.

⚑ **REWIRED 2026-08-02.** Both theorems below took `ShieldedRingApexRefinementResidual` — the alias of
`ShieldedRingDescriptorRefines`, whose `Poseidon2SpongeCR` antecedent
`HashFloorHonesty.poseidon2SpongeCR_false_babyBear` refutes at deployed BabyBear, making both VACUOUSLY
TRUE at the parameters we deploy at. They now take `ShieldedRingDescriptorRefinesKernel` at `S.commit`,
and their `hCR` binders are gone (`hCR` existed only to feed that dead antecedent). The receipt-chain
half of the conclusion travels as `ShieldedRingLogResidual` on the instance the existential binds. See
the ⚰ tombstone at the retired def's former site. -/

⚰ RENAMED from `shieldedRingApexStep_of_accept` (2026-08-02). The old name promised
`ShieldedRingApexStep` from an accept; what an accept plus the sound rung actually delivers is the
kernel-endpoint half, and `ShieldedRingApexStep` only under `ShieldedRingLogResidual f pre post`.

⚠ **NOTHING REAL IS LOST, and say the reason at the right resolution.** The old theorem was not merely
"weaker in a way we now admit": at deployed BabyBear it was UNAPPLICABLE, because its `hCR :
Poseidon2SpongeCR hash` binder is refuted there
(`HashFloorHonesty.poseidon2SpongeCR_false_babyBear`) — and its one Market-specific premise, `hmarket`,
was FREE there for the same reason, so it constrained the ring circuit in no way either. Unusable
premise plus empty premise; a non-guarantee is replaced by a real guarantee plus a residual the caller
can see and discharge.

Proved by instantiating `shielded_lightclient_kernel_endpoints_free` at `C := S.commit` — the
`CommitSurface` here is only ever read through its `commit` projection, exactly as `ApexFloorFree` §1
observed. -/

proof already discarded the receipt-chain conjunct as `_hlog`. So the log clause does NOT travel here:
this consumer never used it, and the kernel-endpoint rung reproves `StarkMarketClaimExtraction` verbatim.

    allocation lowering. The `turnSpec` conjunct is derived from the receipt-chain equation itself
    (`drexClearing_refines_turnSpec` rewritten by `← hlog`), so it cannot be carried forward without it;
    it is the second half of the same clause, not a separate casualty.

/-! ## 5. The deployed 25-lane settlement-verifier obligation (also open).

The old residual used generic scalar `Root` arguments and therefore hid two load-bearing deployed
facts: Groth16 verifies exactly 25 BabyBear public inputs, and Solidity records a keccak of the tight
big-endian encoding of each eight-lane root.  The exact codec and accept-path checks are executable
below; only the cryptographic/extraction implication remains a residual. -/

/-- **`SettlementVerifierRefinementResidual` (OPEN, tightened):** successful verification of the exact
25-lane statement must extract a fair, kernel-real `DrexClearing`, whose kernel states encode to the
published eight-lane roots and whose ring length is the published `numTurns`.  The chain digest is not
dropped: it is present in `pub.toInputs`, so the same pairing acceptance binds it even though the
Market conclusion does not consume history here.

This is precisely what `settleDrex` cannot establish: `settleDrex` starts after extraction, with `c`
already supplied.  Closing it requires the Groth16 knowledge/soundness bridge through the recursive
STARK wrapper plus the Market shielded-apex extraction above, and a faithful `stateLanes` codec for the
deployed eight-lane state commitment. -/
