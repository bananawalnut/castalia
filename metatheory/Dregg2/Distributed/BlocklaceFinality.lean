# Dregg2.Distributed.BlocklaceFinality — a FAITHFUL, EXECUTABLE model of the node's
# REAL blocklace finalization rule (`blocklace/src/ordering.rs::tau`), wired to the executor.

**The gap this closes.** `Dregg2/Distributed/Consensus.lean` is a free-floating BFT *algebra*: it
carries an *abstract* `Committed` predicate (a `superRatifiedFromLace` record) and proves quorum-
intersection safety over it, but it NEVER models the algorithm the running node actually computes.
The node (`node/src/blocklace_sync.rs::poll_finalized_blocks`) does NOT consult an abstract
"is-committed" oracle: it calls `dregg_blocklace::ordering::tau(&lace, &participants)` — a concrete
function that

  1. `compute_rounds`        — round(b) = 1 + max(round(p) | p ∈ preds), genesis = 1 (DAG depth);
  2. `find_all_final_leaders`— for each wave w, the round-robin `wave_leader(w)`; if it has EXACTLY
     ONE block at the wave-start round (no equivocation) AND that block `is_super_ratified` (a
     supermajority of DISTINCT participants have wave-end blocks that ratify it), it is a final
     leader;
  3. `tau`                   — walk final leaders in wave order, collect each leader's coverage
     (union of causal pasts of ratifying wave-end blocks), take the blocks NEW to this segment
     (minus equivocators), `xsort` them, append — producing the total order;

and then SLICES `ordered[executed_up_to..]` and feeds those turns to `TurnExecutor::execute`.

This module models THAT computed rule — `computeRounds` / `findAllFinalLeaders` / `tauOrder` as
genuine **executable Lean functions over `Lace`** (not an abstract record) — proves a REAL safety
property the node relies on (**no two conflicting final leaders per wave**; for finalized-prefix
monotonicity under lace growth see `Dregg2.Consensus.TauPrefixMonotone`, where it is proved
CONDITIONAL — `tau_finalized_prefix_monotone` under `FinalizedRegionStable` — and REFUTED
unconditionally by an honest-laggard counterexample the live node does NOT exclude), CONNECTS it
to the verified executor
(`Exec.ConsensusExec.executeFinalized`, the cell `execFullForestG` commits onto), and ships a
**DIFFERENTIAL**: the computed Lean `tauOrder` and the Rust `ordering.rs::tau` AGREE on a concrete
multi-node trace (the Lean model reproduces the exact order the node finalizes).

## SCOPE — what is faithful, what is simplified, what is the named residual.

FAITHFUL (matches `ordering.rs` line-for-line as a pure function):
* `computeRounds` — the round = 1 + max(pred rounds), genesis = 1 recurrence (`compute_rounds`).
* `roundToWave` / `waveFirstRound` / `waveLastRound` / `waveLeader` — the wave arithmetic and the
  round-robin `participants[w % len]` leader (`ordering.rs:147..170`).
* `superMajority n = 2n/3 + 1` (`supermajority_threshold`).
* `approves` / `ratifies` / `isSuperRatified` / `findAllFinalLeaders` — the approval→ratification→
  super-ratification ladder over the causal past (`ordering.rs:184..336`), reading the SAME
  equivocation guard (`hasEquivInPast`).

SIMPLIFIED (a faithful PROJECTION, stated, not hidden):
* `causalPastIncl` uses a fuel bound (the lace length) for the BFS — totalizing the DAG walk; the
  Rust `causal_past` is an unbounded BFS over the same edge set. On any concrete (finite, acyclic)
  lace the fuel = |lace| is sufficient, so the two coincide (the differential exhibits this).
* `xsort` intra-segment tie-break is the OPEN-CM-XSORT residual (named in `ConsensusExec`); here we
  linearize a segment by `(round, id)` — deterministic, causal-respecting on the traces we exhibit;
  the SAFETY theorem (no conflicting leader) does NOT depend on the tie-break, only on WHICH leaders
  anchor, exactly as `cordial_agreement` is about the anchor.

The safety theorems proved here — `finalLeaders_one_per_wave` / `tauOrder_deterministic` — are
properties the NODE relies on: a wave anchors at most one leader and the order is a deterministic
function of (lace, participants). "Finalization is append-only" (T5, finalized-prefix
monotonicity) is NOT unconditional for this rule: `Dregg2.Consensus.TauPrefixMonotone` proves it
under `FinalizedRegionStable` (closed finalized region) and exhibits an HONEST counterexample —
a lagging validator's late round-2/round-3 blocks grow an already-final wave's coverage and land
MID-PREFIX — which the node's `executed_up_to` index slicing (`blocklace_sync.rs`) does not
tolerate. See that module's header for the node-side implication.

sorts by `(seq, creator)` before building the ordering lace — `build_ordering_blocklace`), which is
a topological order for the honest virtual-chain discipline (`seq` strictly increases along an

/-! ## 5. `findAllFinalLeaders` — the wave loop (`ordering.rs:283..336`).

For each wave `w` from `0` up to the wave containing `maxRound`: take the round-robin
`waveLeader w`. Collect that creator's blocks at the wave-START round. If there is EXACTLY ONE
(no equivocation at the leader slot) AND it `isSuperRatified` by the wave-END round, it is a final
leader. We bound the wave count by `maxRound` (the deepest block), which the node bounds by
`max_round`. -/

equivocating, which forfeits the wave. -/

  | _   => none  -- zero candidates (leader silent) OR ≥2 (leader equivocated at the slot)

/-- **`findAllFinalLeaders`** — the final leaders in wave order. We iterate waves `0..waveCount`
where `waveCount` is the wave containing `maxRound` (the node breaks when `wave_end > max_round`).

/-! ## 6. `tauOrder` — the total order (`ordering.rs::tau`, lines 402..480).

Walk final leaders in wave order; for each, collect coverage (union of causal pasts of ratifying
wave-end blocks), take the NEW blocks (minus previous coverage, minus equivocators), linearize, and
append. The intra-segment linearization is the OPEN-CM-XSORT residual; here we sort by `(round, id)`
— deterministic and causal-respecting (a pred has strictly smaller round). -/

/-- The coverage of a final leader: union of causal pasts of all wave-end blocks that ratify it
(`ordering.rs:442..458`). -/
def leaderCoverage (B : Lace) (participants : List AuthorId) (l : Block) (wavelength : Nat) : List BlockId :=

  (endBlocks.flatMap (fun bid => match B.lookup bid with
     | some b => if ratifies B participants b l then causalPastIncl B bid else []
     | none   => [])).dedup

/-- Deterministic intra-segment linearization by `(round, id)` — the OPEN-CM-XSORT stand-in. A
predecessor has a strictly smaller round, so this respects causal order; ties (concurrent blocks)

    roundOf B a < roundOf B b || (roundOf B a == roundOf B b && a < b))).toList

/-- **`leaderSegment B participants wavelength prevCovered l`** — the blocks a final leader `l`
APPENDS to the order: its coverage minus the previously-covered set, minus equivocators visible
from the leader, linearized by `xsortBy`. The per-leader segment of `ordering.rs::tau`'s loop
body, hoisted so the prefix-monotonicity analysis (`Consensus.TauPrefixMonotone`) can speak
about one wave's contribution. -/

      | some b => ¬ hasEquivInPast B l.id b.creator
      | none   => false)
  xsortBy B newBlocks

/-- **`tauStep`** — one iteration of `ordering.rs::tau`'s leader loop: append the leader's
segment to the order accumulated so far, and replace `prevCovered` with this leader's coverage
(exactly the Rust `prev_covered = coverage`). Hoisted to the top level so the fold is a named
object theorems can decompose. -/
def tauStep (B : Lace) (participants : List AuthorId) (wavelength : Nat)
    (acc : List BlockId × List BlockId) (l : Block) : List BlockId × List BlockId :=

/-! ## 7. THE SAFETY PROPERTY — no two conflicting final leaders per wave + determinism.

The property the node RELIES on: a wave anchors AT MOST ONE final leader, and the finalized order
is a deterministic function of `(lace, participants, wavelength)` — so two honest replicas that see
the same lace compute the SAME finalized order, hence (composed with `ConsensusExec.executeFinalized`
determinism) the SAME executed state. This is the computed-rule analogue of `cordial_agreement`'s
single-anchor — proved DIRECTLY over the node's `find_all_final_leaders` function, not an abstract
record. -/

/-- **`finalLeaderAt_unique` (single anchor per wave, the SAFETY tooth).** `finalLeaderAt`
returns AT MOST ONE leader for a wave: it is an `Option Block` whose `some` branch fires ONLY when
the leader slot has EXACTLY ONE candidate. So a wave cannot anchor two distinct final leaders — the
no-conflicting-leader property, read straight off the node's computed rule. Two `some` results for
the same `(B, participants, wave, wavelength)` are EQUAL (`Option` is a function value). -/
theorem finalLeaderAt_unique (B : Lace) (participants : List AuthorId) (wave wavelength : Nat)
    (l₁ l₂ : Block)
    (h₁ : finalLeaderAt B participants wave wavelength = some l₁)
    (h₂ : finalLeaderAt B participants wave wavelength = some l₂) :
    l₁ = l₂ := by
  rw [h₁] at h₂; exact Option.some.inj h₂

/-- **`finalLeaderAt_needs_unique_candidate` (the anti-equivocation tooth).** A wave yields
a final leader ONLY when its leader slot has exactly one candidate block: if the round-robin leader
equivocates at the slot (`≥ 2` candidates) or is silent (`0`), `finalLeaderAt = none`. So a forking
leader CANNOT anchor a wave — the equivocation guard the node enforces, proved over the rule. -/
theorem finalLeaderAt_needs_unique_candidate (B : Lace) (participants : List AuthorId)
    (wave wavelength : Nat) (l : Block)
    (h : finalLeaderAt B participants wave wavelength = some l) :
    leaderCandidates B participants wave wavelength = [l] := by
  unfold finalLeaderAt at h
  -- case-split on the candidate list shape; only the singleton branch can produce `some`.
  cases hc : leaderCandidates B participants wave wavelength with
  | nil => rw [hc] at h; simp at h
  | cons x xs =>
    cases xs with
    | nil =>
      rw [hc] at h
      -- singleton: the `if` either returns `some x` or `none`.

      · simp only [hsr] at h; exact absurd h (by simp)
    | cons y ys => rw [hc] at h; simp at h

/-- **`tauOrder_deterministic` (the determinism tooth).** The finalized order is a
deterministic FUNCTION of `(lace, participants, wavelength)`: two computations from the same inputs
are equal. So two honest replicas with the same lace finalize the SAME order — the consensus-side of
"no two conflicting finalized states" (the execution-side is `ConsensusExec.executeFinalized` being a
function). Trivial as Lean (`tauOrder` is a `def`), but it is the load-bearing STATEMENT: agreement
reduces to seeing the same lace. -/
theorem tauOrder_deterministic (B : Lace) (participants : List AuthorId) (wavelength : Nat)
    (o₁ o₂ : List BlockId)
    (h₁ : tauOrder B participants wavelength = o₁)
    (h₂ : tauOrder B participants wavelength = o₂) :
    o₁ = o₂ := by rw [← h₁, ← h₂]

/-- **`findAllFinalLeaders_deterministic`.** The final-leader set is a deterministic
function of the inputs — equal laces ⇒ equal final-leader lists. The anchor sequence the node
finalizes is reproducible. -/
theorem findAllFinalLeaders_deterministic (B : Lace) (participants : List AuthorId) (wavelength : Nat)
    (xs ys : List Block)
    (h₁ : findAllFinalLeaders B participants wavelength = xs)
    (h₂ : findAllFinalLeaders B participants wavelength = ys) :
    xs = ys := by rw [← h₁, ← h₂]

/-- **`finalLeaders_one_per_wave` (the structural agreement, indexed by wave).** Reading
`findAllFinalLeaders` through `finalLeaderAt`, the leader anchoring ANY GIVEN wave is unique:
whatever the node lists as the final leader of wave `w` is the single `finalLeaderAt … w …` value, so
two computations cannot disagree on a wave's anchor. This is the executable-model face of
`Proof.CordialMiners.cordial_agreement` — proved DIRECTLY over the node's `find_all_final_leaders`
rule (its `Option`-valued per-wave body), not an abstract `Committed` record. -/

    l₁ = l₂ :=
  finalLeaderAt_unique B participants wave wavelength l₁ l₂ h₁ h₂

/-! ## 8. THE EXECUTOR CONNECTION — the computed `tauOrder` DRIVES the verified executor.

This is the load-bearing wire the task names: the running node (`blocklace_sync.rs::poll_finalized_blocks`)
computes the finalized order with `ordering.rs::tau`, then slices `ordered[executed_up_to..]` and feeds
those turns to its state machine (`execute_finalized_turn` → `TurnExecutor` / the Lean FFI). Here the
SAME computed order (`tauOrder`, the executable model of `ordering.rs::tau`) is resolved to its blocks,
decoded (the §8 `Decoder` seam, `Block → Turn`), and folded through the VERIFIED executor
`Exec.ConsensusExec.executeFinalized` (= `recCexec` over `RecChainedState`, the cell `execFullForestG`
commits onto). So consensus's actual output is a legal input to the proved executor — the two towers
TOUCH at the `tauOrder` value. -/

open Dregg2.Exec.ConsensusExec (Decoder executeFinalized finalized_run finalized_execution_agreement)
open Dregg2.Exec (RecChainedState recChainedSystem)

def tauBlocks (B : Lace) (participants : List AuthorId) (wavelength : Nat) : List Block :=
  (tauOrder B participants wavelength).filterMap B.lookup

/-- **`executeTau dec s0 B participants wavelength`** — THE WIRE. Compute the finalized order with
the executable model of `ordering.rs::tau`, resolve to blocks, decode each to its executor `Turn`
(`Decoder`, the §8 wire-decode seam), and fold the VERIFIED `executeFinalized` (`recCexec`) from
genesis `s0`. This is exactly what the node does: `tau` ↦ decode ↦ run the state machine in order. -/
def executeTau (dec : Decoder) (s0 : RecChainedState)
    (B : Lace) (participants : List AuthorId) (wavelength : Nat) : Option RecChainedState :=
  executeFinalized s0 ((tauBlocks B participants wavelength).map dec)

/-- **`tau_drives_verified_run` (the executor connection, part (a)).** A successful
`executeTau` over the COMPUTED finalized order IS a `Run recChainedSystem` from genesis: every
finalized turn is a `recCexec` commit, so the node's actual `tau` output drives a *well-defined
executed run of the verified record cell*. Consensus's computed order is a legal input to the proved
executor — the consensus tower and the executor tower are connected at the `tauOrder` value, end to
end. Rides `ConsensusExec.finalized_run`. -/
theorem tau_drives_verified_run (dec : Decoder) (s0 s' : RecChainedState)
    (B : Lace) (participants : List AuthorId) (wavelength : Nat)
    (h : executeTau dec s0 B participants wavelength = some s') :
    Run recChainedSystem s0 s' :=
  finalized_run _ h

/-- **`tau_execution_agreement` (the executor connection, part (b): consensus-to-state
agreement).** Two honest replicas that observe the SAME lace `B` (with the same participants/wavelength)
compute the SAME `tauOrder` (`tauOrder_deterministic`), hence the same decoded turn sequence, hence —
since `executeFinalized` is a function (`finalized_execution_agreement`) — the SAME executed state.
So "no two conflicting finalized states" reduces to "the replicas see the same lace": the consensus
order determinism (this module) composed with the executor determinism (`ConsensusExec`) gives
end-to-end state agreement. This is the safety property the NODE relies on, proved through BOTH towers. -/

    (h₂ : executeTau dec s0 B participants wavelength = r₂) :

  -- both reduce to `executeFinalized s0 (same decoded list)`; `tauOrder` is a function of (B,P,w).

/-! ## 9. NON-VACUITY — a CONCRETE multi-node trace the model FINALIZES.

The executable rule is not an empty abstraction: on a concrete 3-node / 3-round fully-connected lace
(the SAME shape as the Rust `ordering.rs::test_three_node_one_wave_finalized`) the model finalizes ALL
nine blocks, with EXACTLY ONE final leader (creator `1`'s genesis, the wave-0 round-robin leader),
matching the Rust test's `result.len() == 9`. And on an equivocating-leader trace the equivocator is
EXCLUDED (the Rust `test_equivocating_block_excluded`). These `#guard`s are the model⟺node differential
on a real trace: the Lean rule reproduces the node's finalization. -/

/-- **THE DIFFERENTIAL GOLDEN VECTOR** — the finalized order projected to `(creator, seq)` pairs.
This is the level at which the Lean model and the Rust `ordering.rs::tau` are compared: the abstract
`BlockId` is a `Nat` here vs. a blake3 hash in Rust, but the `(creator, seq)` coordinate of each
finalized block is content-identical, so AGREEMENT on this projection IS the model⟺node differential.
The Rust side checks `ordering::tau(&lace, &participants)` over the same DAG yields this same sequence
(see `node`/`blocklace` differential test referencing this vector). -/

/-! The `#guard`s above are the project's machine-checked non-vacuity teeth (the sanctioned
mechanism for executable, `qsort`-laden defs — a false `#guard` is a BUILD ERROR, exactly like a
failed test). They establish, against a CONCRETE trace, that: (i) the model finalizes all nine blocks
of the 3-node lace (the Rust `result.len() == 9`); (ii) there is EXACTLY ONE final leader, creator 1's
genesis (the single-anchor `finalLeaders_one_per_wave` is witnessed non-vacuously); (iii) the golden
`(creator, seq)` differential vector is the exact deterministic causal order the node finalizes; and
(iv) an equivocating leader anchors NOTHING and contributes no finalized block. So the safety theorems
constrain a REAL, non-trivial finalized order, and the model reproduces the node's finalization. -/
