# Dregg2.Shielded.RealCrypto — retire the two toy crypto stand-ins the critic flagged in rung-3.

Rung-3 private matching (`Market/ShieldedClearing.lean`) was proved over TWO declared toys:

  * the value commitment `refVC.commit v r = (v + r).toNat` (`Exec/ShieldedValue.lean`) —
    ADDITIVE in a single `Nat` coordinate, so it is **not binding** (it collapses `(v, r)`:
    `commit 8 3 = commit 3 8 = 11`) and carries **no hiding/binding assumption** at all;
  * the tree root `refTreeRoot leaves = leaves.foldl (·*31 + · + 1) 7`
    (`Shielded/ClaimRefinement.lean`) — a LINEAR rolling hash with **no collision-resistance**;
    its "binding" was arithmetic invertibility, not a cryptographic floor.

This module re-grounds both halves on the REAL crypto the codebase already carries, with the
honest floors NAMED (not laundered):

  * **§1 — REAL PEDERSEN** (`Dregg2.Crypto.Pedersen` / `Crypto.Primitives.CryptoPrimitives`):
    the value commitment is the two-generator group Pedersen `commit v r = v·G + r·H` over an
    `AddCommGroup` `Digest`, whose additive homomorphism `commit_hom` is PROVED and whose
    **binding rests on the discrete-log carrier `CryptoPrimitives.binding`** (a `Prop`, never a
    Lean law). The hidden conservation `Σ C_in = Σ C_out` is re-proved over THIS real commitment
    (`ring_conserves_pedersen` / `_list`, off `committed_conservation` / `listCommit_collapse`),
    so "hidden conservation" now holds over a hiding+binding Pedersen, not the additive toy. The
    key structural gap the toy hid: a real Pedersen is **not `Nat`-additive** — it lives in a
    group — so `ValueCommitment.hom` (Nat-additivity) was only ever satisfiable by a linear
    stand-in. The real conservation therefore lives at the GROUP layer here.

  * **§2 — REAL POSEIDON2 TREE**: the tree root is `sponge leaves`, and root-binds-the-leaf-set is
    stated as `root_binds_or_collides` — a forged membership (a committed set faked to hit an honest
    root) EITHER is the honest set OR HANDS BACK a named Poseidon2 collision. The linear rolling hash
    is gone. ⚑ **THE `spongeCR` FIELD IS DELETED (2026-07-25 bundle cutover).** It carried
    `Poseidon2SpongeCR sponge`, which `HashFloorHonesty.poseidon2SpongeCR_false_babyBear` REFUTES at
    deployed BabyBear parameters — so `Poseidon2Tree` was UNINHABITABLE and every `∀ T` theorem below
    was vacuous. §2.0 records the design decision for the whole bundle family; §2.2 constructs
    `deployedPoseidon2Tree` and proves its own sponge refutes the deleted field.

  * **§3 — COMPOSE**: the rung-3 shape (hidden conservation + membership) restated over the two
    real primitives, each conditioned on its honest floor (DLog binding / Poseidon2 CR).

## HONEST GRADE
The conservation ALGEBRA (`commit_hom`/`map_sum`), the no-wrap range REDUCTION (`twoLeg_noWrap_…`),
the value-binding CR REDUCTION (§1.3: CR ⇒ injective on `(value, asset)`), and the tree root-binding
REDUCTION (§2: CR ⇒ injective) are all unconditional Lean.

## §PQ CUTOVER (`docs/deos/PQ-SHIELDED-COMMITMENT.md`, Option A) — the value-binding floor MOVED.
The AUTHORITATIVE shielded value-binding is no longer the DLog Pedersen: it is the in-AIR Poseidon2
`value_binding = hash_fact(value, [asset_type, randomness, 0])`, binding `(value, asset_type)` jointly
under `HashCR` (§1.3, `ValueBindingCommit.binds_value_and_asset` / `mint_forces_collision`) — a
QUANTUM-SAFE floor. The no-mint (conservation + no-wrap range) is the fully-in-AIR STARK gate
(`Poseidon2ChipArithSound`, field-conservation `Σ` + the `VALUE_BITS` range gadget refined here by
`inAir_conservation_refines_pedersen`), also quantum-safe. So the residual crypto for the shielded
value-side is now exactly `HashCR` (Poseidon2 CR) + STARK soundness — the SAME floors the tree/
nullifier stand on — NOT discrete-log.

The §1 `pedTwoGen` conservation MODEL (whose `binding` names DLog) is retained as the group-Pedersen
ALGEBRA the in-AIR field conservation refines; the DLog `binding` carrier is NO LONGER the
value-binding floor (that is §1.3's `HashCR`), and the off-AIR Pedersen/Schnorr/Bulletproof are
retired from the value-binding TCB. NAMED RESIDUAL (separate frontier, NOT this cutover): the fhEgg
homomorphic-fold's PQ-lattice-additive commitment for aggregating independently-produced commitments
(Option B / the aggregation layer), and the full 64-bit multi-limb in-AIR range widening (the current
gadget is sound over the BabyBear no-wrap range, `< 2^VALUE_BITS`).

/-! ## §1 — REAL PEDERSEN value commitment (retires `refVC`).

The real Pedersen commitment is `commit v r = v·G + r·H` over a group `Digest`. We reuse the
proved conservation of `Dregg2.Crypto.Pedersen` (`committed_conservation`, `listCommit_collapse`)
and expose it as the shielded-ring hidden-conservation over the REAL commitment, with the DLog
`binding` carrier named. -/

/-- **`ring_conserves_pedersen` — hidden conservation over the REAL group Pedersen.** If the ring's
input and output notes carry equal value sums AND equal blinding sums, their Pedersen COMMITMENT
sums are equal — `Σ commit(vᵢ_in, rᵢ_in) = Σ commit(vⱼ_out, rⱼ_out)`, so the homomorphic excess is
zero and a verifier confirms conservation over the commitments alone, learning no single amount.
This is `shielded_ring_value_conserves_hidden` re-grounded on the two-generator group commitment
(`CryptoPrimitives.commit`, `commit_hom` PROVED); the step from the commitment equation to the
VALUE equation is the `CryptoPrimitives.binding` (DLog) carrier — NAMED, not asserted. -/

/-! ### §1.1 — a genuine two-generator Pedersen instance (NOT the additive `v+r` / `.toNat` toy).

`commit v r := (v, r)` over `ℤ × ℤ` is the free two-generator commitment `v·(1,0) + r·(0,1)`: the
generators `G = (1,0)`, `H = (0,1)` are independent, so — unlike the toy — the commitment is
BINDING (perfectly here; computationally under DLog on a real curve) and keeps `value` and
`blinding` in separate coordinates. This witnesses the parametric theorems above non-vacuously and
exhibits the exact binding the toy lacked. -/

/-- A two-generator Pedersen `CryptoPrimitives` instance over `ℤ × ℤ` (a `def`, not a global
`instance`, to avoid silent auto-resolution): `commit v r = v·(1,0) + r·(0,1) = (v, r)`. The
`commit_hom` is the group law `(v+w, r+s) = (v,r) + (w,s)`. Hardness carriers are the honest
NAMES — `binding` = the two generators have no known DLog relation (real curve), `collisionHard`
= Poseidon2 CR — inhabited here by `True` only for the witness (real crypto discharges them). -/

/-- **THE TOY WAS NOT BINDING.** `refVC` (`commit v r = (v+r).toNat`) collapses distinct openings:

the exact defect this module retires. -/

/-! ### §1.2 — the in-AIR RANGE GADGET's meaning: field conservation + range ⇒ INTEGER conservation.

The historical circuit realization (the now-retired `shielded_ring_clearing_air.rs`, clause (c)) enforced the
conservation `Σ value_in − Σ value_out = 0` as a BabyBear FIELD gate. A field equation ALONE is NOT
integer conservation: a value-minting ring can satisfy `Σ value_in ≡ Σ value_out (mod p)` by
WRAPAROUND (an output committed to `p − k`, a "wrapped negative"), minting real value while the field
sum stays fixed. The AIR's in-AIR RANGE GADGET bit-decomposes every conservation value into
`[0, 2^k)` with `RING_LEGS · 2^k ≤ p` — which is exactly what forces the field gate to be the INTEGER
`hval` hypothesis `ring_conserves_pedersen_list` consumes. These two lemmas ARE that reduction: the
Lean meaning of the range gadget, tying the in-AIR conservation to the real group Pedersen. -/

/-- **No-wraparound reduction (2-leg, matching the deployed `RING_LEGS = 2` AIR).** Two
range-bounded inputs and two range-bounded outputs (each `< 2^k`, with `2·2^k ≤ p` — the BabyBear
no-wrap bound the AIR asserts at compile time) whose FIELD sums agree mod `p` have EQUAL INTEGER
sums. The range bound is LOAD-BEARING: drop any `_ < 2^k` and the conclusion is false (wraparound
mints) — the exact field-soundness the in-AIR range gadget supplies.

CONSOLIDATED onto the audited bedrock: this is the `k = 2` instance of the unified library keystone
`Dregg2.Bignum.legs_noWrap_conservation` (which was written to generalize exactly this lemma from the
deployed `RING_LEGS = 2` to any leg count). One audited no-wrap proof, instantiated here — not a
second hand-rolled copy. -/

notes and two output notes whose VALUES are range-bounded (the in-AIR range gadget) and whose value
sums agree mod `p` (the in-AIR field conservation gate), and whose BLINDING sums are equal, their
REAL two-generator Pedersen commitment sums are equal. The range-gadget hypotheses are precisely what
upgrade the field gate to the integer `hval` that `ring_conserves_pedersen_list` needs — so the

/-! ### §1.3 — the PQ VALUE-BINDING: a Poseidon2 HASH COMMITMENT binding (value, asset), under HashCR.

The PQ cutover (`docs/deos/PQ-SHIELDED-COMMITMENT.md`, Option A) retires the DLog Pedersen
value-commitment as the AUTHORITATIVE shielded value-binding. The authoritative commitment is now the
in-AIR Poseidon2 `value_binding = hash_fact(value, [asset_type, randomness, 0])` (the spend circuit's
C7 PI in the now-retired `spend_circuit.rs`). Its binding rests on Poseidon2
collision-resistance (`HashCR`) — a QUANTUM-SAFE floor (Grover only halves CR) — NOT discrete-log.

This section names that floor, exactly as §2 names the Poseidon2 TREE root-binding: an
injective-under-CR hash commitment. The `binding` carrier here is `HashCR` (Poseidon2 CR), the PQ
REPLACEMENT for `pedCommit_binding` (DLog). The floor has MOVED from discrete-log to hash CR, so the
shielded no-mint value-binding now survives Shor. -/

/-- A **Poseidon2 value-binding commitment**: the hash `vbind value asset r` the spend circuit's C7
publishes (`hash_fact(value, [asset_type, randomness, 0])`), and the SOLE crypto carrier —

the SAME Poseidon2 CR the tree root-binding §2 and the nullifier stand on). -/

(Shor-safe). This is the PQ replacement for `pedCommit_binding`: the floor moved from DLog to HashCR. -/

/-! ## §2 — REAL POSEIDON2 tree (retires `refTreeRoot`).

The note-commitment tree root is the Poseidon2 sponge over the leaf list — `root = sponge leaves`,
mirroring the deployed `StateCommit` sponge-root — with the SINGLE named crypto floor
`Poseidon2SpongeCR sponge` (the SAME sponge CR `SortedTreeNonMembership` / `StateCommit` bind
under). Root-binds-the-leaf-set is then a REDUCTION to that CR, replacing the linear rolling hash
`refTreeRoot` (which had no collision-resistance at all). -/

/-- **A real Poseidon2 note-commitment tree**: the sponge it folds the leaf set through.

⚑ **ONE FIELD, AND IT IS INHABITED AT DEPLOYED PARAMETERS.** The `spongeCR : Poseidon2SpongeCR sponge`
field is GONE. It asserted INJECTIVITY of a map from the infinite `List ℤ` into ONE bounded BabyBear
felt, which `HashFloorHonesty.poseidon2SpongeCR_false_babyBear` REFUTES for every real Poseidon2
`hash_many` — so no deployed `Poseidon2Tree` value could be constructed and every theorem of the form
`∀ T : Poseidon2Tree, …` (this file's §2, and `Market.ShieldedClearing.shielded_rung3_real_crypto`)
was VACUOUS. §2.2 constructs `deployedPoseidon2Tree`, a real value whose sponge is deployed-shaped
(BabyBear-bounded output) and whose own sponge therefore REFUTES the deleted field
(`deployedPoseidon2Tree_sponge_not_Poseidon2SpongeCR`). The collision resistance the tree used to
assume is now EXTRACTED AS DATA: see `Poseidon2Binding.SpongeColl` and `root_binds_or_collides`.

This is the `Cap8Scheme`/`Heap8Scheme`/`Fields8Scheme` cure (`Circuit.DeployedCapTree` §5b.D)
transported to the shielded note tree, and it is the TEMPLATE for the whole bundle family — see
§2.0 for the design decision every other bundle lane should follow. -/

/-! ### §2.0 — ⚑ THE BUNDLE-FAMILY DESIGN DECISION (read this before porting another bundle).

Two shapes were available for a structure carrying a refuted floor as a FIELD:

  **(A) side-condition-in-`binds`** — DELETE the field; the structure keeps only DATA (the carrier
  function). Each theorem the bundle used to prove by PROJECTING the field is replaced by a total
  extractor plus `binding ∨ Coll carrier (extractor args)`, and the same-named theorem regains its
  original equality conclusion under a PER-INSTANCE `¬ Coll carrier (extractor args)` side condition.

  **(B) a `noColl` FIELD** — swap `spongeCR : Poseidon2SpongeCR sponge` for a non-collision field.

**THE DECISION IS (A), UNIFORMLY, FOR BUNDLES.** The reason is not taste, it is that (B) cannot be
discharged at a deployed instance. A bundle field is fixed once, for the whole life of the value,
with NO arguments to instantiate it at; so a `noColl` field must quantify over some set of pairs
chosen in advance. Whatever set is chosen, either it is empty (the field carries nothing) or it is
non-trivial — and then discharging it for a REAL Poseidon2 sponge is exactly the claim pigeonhole
refutes, at a subtler width. (B) would therefore rebuild uninhabitability while removing the floor
NAME the ruler counts: laundering, not reduction.

**THE ASYMMETRY WITH THREADERS IS DELIBERATE.** A THEOREM does have arguments, so it CAN carry a
per-instance `¬ Coll … (extractorFind <the exact proof arguments>)` hypothesis — which is precisely
what the `ListCommit` cutover landed, and it is implied by the old floor
(`Poseidon2Binding.spongeColl_refutable_of_injective`), hence strictly stronger. Threaders get the
hypothesis; BUNDLES get no Prop field at all. The two halves of the campaign get different answers
because a field has no argument position to be per-instance AT.

**ACCEPTANCE TEST for any bundle port:** a deployed-shaped INHABITANT is constructible, and its own
carrier REFUTES the deleted field. A green build proves nothing here; the inhabitant does. -/

/-- **⚑ THE EXTRACTOR (TOTAL).** On a root equivocation, the pair of leaf lists the deployed sponge
actually absorbed. No `Classical.choice`, no search: the two claimed leaf sets ARE the candidate
collision, because `root` applies the sponge to them directly. -/
def Poseidon2Tree.rootCollFind (l₁ l₂ : List ℤ) : List ℤ × List ℤ := (l₁, l₂)

/-- **`root_binds_or_collides` — THE ROOT BINDS ITS LEAF SET, UNCONDITIONALLY.** Two leaf sets with
the same root EITHER are the same set, OR the pair `rootCollFind` hands back is a GENUINE collision of
the deployed sponge. No injectivity hypothesis anywhere — this holds OF the deployed system, which is
exactly what the `spongeCR`-carrying original never did. -/

  by_cases hl : l₁ = l₂
  · exact Or.inl hl
  · exact Or.inr ⟨hl, h⟩

/-- **`Poseidon2Tree.root_binds` — THE ROOT BINDS ITS LEAF SET.** SAME NAME, SAME CONCLUSION as the
version that projected the deleted `spongeCR` field; the crypto content is now a PER-INSTANCE side
condition at the EXACT pair the proof is about, rather than a universally-false injectivity claim
baked into the type. STRICTLY STRONGER than the original: the old `spongeCR` field discharges this

The reference injective sponge `Poseidon2Binding.Reference.refSponge` (`Encodable.encode`, whose range
is NOT field-bounded) refutes every `SpongeColl`, so at `refTree` the per-instance side conditions are
DISCHARGED IN-FILE and `refTree_root_binds` / `refTree_forge_impossible` keep their ORIGINAL statements
verbatim. ⚑ Honest scope, unchanged from before the cure: this is the toy witness, NOT the deployed
sponge — `refSponge` is exactly the FALSE COMFORT `HashFloorHonesty`'s header names. The deployed
instance is §2.2, and there the side condition is the real content. -/

/-! ### §2.2 — ⚑ THE ACCEPTANCE TEST: a REAL DEPLOYED `Poseidon2Tree` VALUE.

What deleting the `spongeCR` field bought is measured HERE, not by a green build. With the field
present `Poseidon2Tree` had NO deployed inhabitant — `poseidon2SpongeCR_false_babyBear` refutes the
field for any sponge landing in a bounded BabyBear felt, which every real `hash_many` does — so every
`∀ T : Poseidon2Tree, …` theorem in §2/§3 (and `Market.ShieldedClearing`'s re-export) was vacuously
true, and the only witness on offer was `refTree`'s unbounded `Encodable.encode`.

`deployedPoseidon2Tree` is a VALUE. Its sponge is DEPLOYED-SHAPED in the only respect the vacuity
argument ever turned on: it takes an arbitrary-length `List ℤ` to ONE felt reduced into `[0, p)`.
Decisively, its own sponge REFUTES the deleted field. That is the tightest statement of what changed:
**the very function the teeth refute now INHABITS the structure.**

⚑ Honest scope: not a KAT-faithful Poseidon2 (none exists in Lean here), so this is not a byte
differential against the Rust `hash_many`. It is a deployed-SHAPED inhabitant, and shape is exactly
what the vacuity argument was about.

⚑ DEBT REPORTED, NOT PROVEN AROUND: `Poseidon2Tree.sponge : List ℤ → ℤ` is a ONE-FELT (~31-bit,
2^15.5-collidable) commitment to the note-commitment leaf set. That narrowing is the felt-width wound
(`docs/WOUND-felt-width-boundaries-2026-07-19.md`), pre-existing in this module and NOT introduced
here; the repair is an 8-felt (~124-bit) tree digest, and it is a separate lane. This section models
the width that is deployed so the refutation bites the deployed object. -/

/-- **A DEPLOYED-SHAPED Poseidon2 sponge.** Arbitrary-length input list, ONE output felt reduced into
`[0, p)` for the deployed BabyBear prime `p = 2³¹ − 2²⁷ + 1`. This is the shape of the real
