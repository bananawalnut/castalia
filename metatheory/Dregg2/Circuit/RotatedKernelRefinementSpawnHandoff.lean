# Dregg2.Circuit.RotatedKernelRefinementSpawnHandoff — the spawn parent→child CAPABILITY HANDOFF,
  FORCED in-circuit via the deployed sorted cap-tree INSERT (`CapTreeUpdate.capInsert_sound`).

## What this closes (the spawn PHASE-D residual)

`RotatedKernelRefinementBirth.lean` closed spawn at VALUE_PARTIAL: the accounts insert + born-empty
growth is FORCED (via the committed `accountsRoot`), but the parent→child CAPABILITY HANDOFF — the
child's cap-tree gains the parent's conferred cap — was carried as the NAMED `capHandoff`/
`delegateHandoff`/`delegationsHandoff` residual, because the live descriptor pins `cap_root` FROZEN
(`gCapPass`): a frozen-root gate structurally cannot witness a cap-tree UPDATE.

The PHASE-D gadget (`SortedTreeNonMembership` → `CapTreeUpdate.capInsert_sound`) is exactly the
OPENABLE sorted cap-tree update that was "NOT yet available" when the Birth rung was written. This
module USES it: the spawn handoff IS an INSERT of the child's freshly-conferred cap key into the
committed cap-tree, so `capInsert_sound` FORCES the key-set growth (`keysOf newRoot = insert childKey
(keysOf oldRoot)`) against the REAL deployed binary-Merkle commitment — replacing the frozen `gCapPass`
with the handoff insert gate, exactly as `RotatedKernelRefinementCapFamily.delegate_descriptorRefines`
forces the delegate insert.

## The honest class — what is FORCED, what is the named carrier (NOT laundered)

`spawnHandoffEncodes` (DATA-bearing, like `DelegateCapsTreeEncodes`) bundles:

  1. **the sorted-tree INSERT data** — `SpineCommits S oldRoot spine` (the OLD child-cap_root binds the
     spine), the handoff key `childKey` FRESH (`childKey ∉ keysOf oldRoot` — the child had no such cap),
     and `SpineCommits S newRoot (sortedInsert childKey spine)` (the NEW child-cap_root binds the grown
     spine). From these `capInsert_sound` FORCES the exact key-set move — the handoff is now circuit-
     forced at the SET level against the real commitment, NOT frozen.

  2. **the `Caps`-function residual** — the kernel-side `post.caps = spawnCapsMap …` / `post.delegate =
     spawnDelegateMap …` / `post.delegations = spawnDelegationsMap …` equalities. The lift from the
     committed key-SET insert (forced) to the resulting `Caps`-FUNCTION equality is the FAITHFUL
     cap-tree↔kernel-`Caps` ENCODING residual — exactly the residual class
     `RotatedKernelRefinementCapFamily.DelegateCapsTreeEncodes.capsMove` carries (a HYPOTHESIS, never an
     axiom, never a fake).

So spawn's class moves from VALUE_PARTIAL (handoff FROZEN) to **PROVEN-EXACT(set insert) + the
`Caps`-function move carried as the named faithful-encoding residual** — the SAME honest class the
entire cap-family already lives at. The negative test (`spawn_handoff_rejects_frozen_root`) BITES: a
spawn that FREEZES the child cap_root (`newRoot = oldRoot`, no handoff) while the handoff key is fresh
is UNSAT — the insert gate forces the root to MOVE.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound} + the realizable `CapHashScheme` carriers
(`Compress1CR` via `chipCR`; the `SpineCommits` spine↔root binding) inherited through `CapTreeUpdate`,
plus the realizable `compressNInjective` for the accounts leg (inherited through `RotatedKernel-
RefinementBirth`). NEW file; imports read-only.

/-! ## §1 — the spawn-handoff decode: the FORCED cap-tree INSERT + the `Caps`-function residual.

The spawn handoff writes the parent's conferred cap into the CHILD's cap slot — at the cap-tree level,
an INSERT of the child's new cap key into the committed sorted cap-tree. We bundle the sorted-tree
insert DATA (from which `capInsert_sound` FORCES the key-set move) ALONGSIDE the accounts-growth decode
(`spawnGenuineEncodes`, which forces the accounts insert) and the `Caps`-function residual. -/

/-- **`spawnHandoffEncodes` — the spawn witness ⟷ kernel decode + the FORCED cap-tree INSERT.**
Bundles (1) the EXISTING accounts-growth decode (`birth`, which FORCES the accounts insert + born-empty
growth + carries the guard/frame/log); and (2) the sorted-tree INSERT data for the CHILD's cap_root: the
old child-cap_root binds `spine`, the handoff key `childKey` is FRESH, and the new child-cap_root binds
`sortedInsert childKey spine` — from which `capInsert_sound` FORCES the exact key-set growth. The
`spawnCapsMap`/`spawnDelegateMap`/`spawnDelegationsMap` `Caps`-function equalities ride INSIDE `birth`
(its `capHandoff`/`delegateHandoff`/`delegationsHandoff` fields) — the named faithful-encoding residual,
NOW backed by the FORCED set insert. DATA-bearing (`Type`). -/

cap_root AFTER the handoff is EXACTLY the old set plus the fresh handoff key — forced against the REAL
deployed binary-Merkle commitment (NOT the frozen `gCapPass` of the live descriptor, NOT a felt
accumulator). This is the PHASE-D payoff: the spawn handoff is now circuit-forced at the set level. -/

cap_root genuinely gained the parent's conferred cap key (the handoff happened) — a corollary of the

growth is FORCED (reusing `RotatedKernelRefinementBirth.spawn_descriptorRefines` through the `birth`
decode), and the parent→child CAPABILITY HANDOFF cap-tree INSERT is FORCED at the SET level
(`spawn_handoff_forces_insert`) — the `spawnCapsMap`/`spawnDelegateMap`/`spawnDelegationsMap`
`Caps`-function equalities are delivered from `birth`'s named residual, NOW backed by the forced
insert (the cap-tree↔kernel-`Caps` encoding the commitment cannot itself certify is the SOLE remaining
carrier, exactly the cap-family class). This UPGRADES spawn from the VALUE_PARTIAL frozen-`cap_root`. -/

/-- **`spawn_descriptorRefines_handoff_execFullA` — the refinement against the executor arm.**
`SpawnSpec` IS the `.spawnA` arm of `execFullA` (via `spawnChainA_iff_spec`), so the decode forces a
genuine committed spawn (`execFullA pre (.spawnA actor child target) = some post`). -/

/-! ## §2 — the NEGATIVE test: a spawn that FREEZES the child cap_root (no handoff) is REJECTED.

The whole point of the upgrade: a spawn that claims the handoff but FREEZES the child cap_root
(`newRoot = oldRoot`) cannot ride a satisfying witness — the insert gate forces the committed key set
to GROW by the fresh handoff key, so a frozen root (whose key set is UNCHANGED) is contradictory.
This is precisely the case the live frozen-`gCapPass` descriptor could NOT reject. -/

/-- **`spawn_handoff_rejects_frozen_root` (the NEGATIVE TEST — the handoff insert BITES).** A spawn
witness whose NEW child cap_root EQUALS the OLD child cap_root (`newRoot = oldRoot` — the cap_root
FROZEN, NO handoff performed) is UNSAT: the fresh handoff key `childKey` would have to be BOTH absent
(`hfresh`, in the old/frozen root) AND present (the forced insert grows the key set by it). So a
frozen-cap_root spawn that claims a handoff is rejected in-circuit — exactly what the live `gCapPass`
freeze could NOT catch. -/

/-- **`spawn_handoff_rejects_wrong_accounts` (the accounts tooth, inherited).** A spawn whose post
accounts are NOT `insert child pre.accounts` is UNSAT — the accounts-root gate (the forced birth leg)
bites through the `birth` decode. (Recorded so the handoff rung carries BOTH teeth: the cap-tree insert
AND the accounts insert.) -/

    (hwrong : post.kernel.accounts ≠ insert child pre.kernel.accounts) : False :=
  hwrong (spawn_accounts_forced compressN hN pre post actor child target henc.birth)

/-! ## §3 — NON-VACUITY: the handoff insert is LOAD-BEARING (the key set genuinely moves).

The forced insert is not a no-op: the committed key set after the handoff STRICTLY contains the fresh
handoff key that was absent before. A `newRoot = oldRoot` stub (the frozen `gCapPass`) would make
`spawn_handoff_rejects_frozen_root` unprovable — it is provable, so the handoff genuinely moves the
committed cap-tree. (The set-membership move itself is checked by `CapTreeUpdate`'s own
`#guard`s on `sortedInsert`/`sortedRemove`.) -/

/-- **`spawn_handoff_nonvacuous` — the forced insert STRICTLY grows the child's committed cap key set.**
After the handoff the child's cap_root commits a key (`childKey`) it did NOT commit before — the cap
edge genuinely landed. So the handoff is a real cap-tree move, not a frozen no-op. -/
