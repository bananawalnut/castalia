# Dregg2.Circuit.ShieldedSpendPortDischarge — the spend_circuit → Lean port, security core:
# the two named hypotheses of the shielded falsifier proofs DISCHARGED against the emitted AIR.

**This is the discharge lane of the shielded `spend_circuit` port.** The Rust-authored
shielded-spend AIR (the now-retired `spend_circuit.rs`, `shielded_spend_descriptor()` —
constraints C1–C7b as hand-written `ConstraintExpr` data) is house-law-#1 DEBT. Its Lean re-authoring
already exists as two emitted `EffectVmDescriptor2` objects that Rust only *decodes/witnesses*:

  * `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.ShieldedSpendDescriptor.shieldedSpendDesc` — 4-ary Merkle membership +
    nullifier + note-commitment preimage (C6) + value-binding (C7), with the `merkle_root` claim lane
    PI-pinned to the committed accumulator (the in-AIR #15 fix). Its `root_is_pinned` /
    `spend_relation_row0` prove `Satisfied2 ⟹ (root pinned to the committed PI ∧, under the chip
    AIR's own soundness, row 0 carries the genuine spend relation)`.
  * `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.ShieldedValueLinkDescriptor.shieldedValueLinkDesc` — the value-link +
    Σ-conservation block. Its `value_link_bound` / `conservation_holds` prove `Satisfied2 ⟹ (every
    row's value_binding & leaf_commit are the genuine hash images of ONE shared value cell ∧
    Σ value ≡ Σ out_val [ZMOD p])`.

**What was still missing — and what this module supplies.** The two falsifier proofs
(`ShieldedMerkleRootPin`, seam #15; `ShieldedValueLinkPin`, seam #16) priced the wounds over an
ABSTRACT accumulator model and had to NAME two gaps as free hypotheses, disconnected from any emitted
object:

  * `ShieldedMerkleRootPin.AccumulatorSound` — "a membership witness against the committed root
    certifies a genuinely committed note" — taken abstractly, "exactly as `FinalityCertWidth` takes
    `SigValid`", its discharge deferred to "the full `spend_circuit` AIR port".
  * `ShieldedValueLinkPin.linkHolds` — the `legValue = leafValue` conjunct the deployed conservation
    path omits (`verify_value_link` runs in tests only) — modeled as a free predicate the fix ADDS.

This module connects the abstract falsifier models to the REAL emitted objects and turns each named
hypothesis into a theorem about that object (at the resolution the single emitted trace gives; the
∀-leaf accumulator collision-resistance is reduced to a precisely-named floor, not assumed away):

  * **§A — #15 / `AccumulatorSound`.** `Hair` realizes the abstract per-level fold `H` as the emitted
    `lkParent` Poseidon2 site (`emitted_fold_step_row0`). `OpensAs` realizes the abstract
    `IsCommitted` as the emitted C6 note-commitment shape AT THE TRACE'S OWN CELLS.
    **`emitted_accept_is_committed`** proves, WITH NO `AccumulatorSound` hypothesis, that a satisfying
    `shieldedSpendDesc` trace's accepted leaf is the C6 commitment of row 0's opening cells, its
    membership chain folds to the COMMITTED-accumulator PI, and the claim-root slot cannot decouple
    from it: the emitted C6a/C6b constraints deliver DIRECTLY the "committed" conclusion the abstract
    module could only assume. `NoteAccumulatorCR` names the residual ∀-leaf floor (the deferred
    multi-row fold-walk + Poseidon2 CR), and `pin_accept_is_note` composes the abstract keystone at
    the faithful realization with that floor NAMED — no blanket abstract assumption.

    ⚠ **CORRECTED 2026-07-24 (the ∃-image sweep, `Verify.ExistsImageVacuity`).** `IsCommittedNote` is
    an ∃-IMAGE: under `ShieldedOnRampPin.C6Surjective` — expected of a real Poseidon2 with four free
    field inputs onto ~2^31 — it holds of EVERY felt, so a conclusion stated at it excludes nothing.
    The cell-pinned `OpensAs` is what this AIR actually forces and is strictly stronger
    (`isCommittedNote_does_not_pin_the_opening`); the theorems still stated at `IsCommittedNote`
    (`emitted_leaf_isCommittedNote`, `pin_accept_is_note_committed`) are labeled weakenings kept for
    downstream, each carrying the reason it is NOT strengthened to the authorization-carrying
    `ShieldedOnRampPin.IsLedgerNote:237` — **this AIR does not force authorization and could not**;
    that conjunct is supplied by the accumulator/on-ramp side and enters through `pin_accept_is_note`'s
    floor.
  * **§B — #16 / `linkHolds`.** `emitted_conserved_is_leaf_bound` proves the value that CONSERVES
    (`valAt = rowAt · cVAL`) is, on every row, the SAME cell hashed into the published `leaf_commit`
    and `value_binding` — leg and leaf are ONE in-AIR cell, so the deployed `legValue ≠ leafValue`
    mint is unrepresentable. `emitted_minted_equals_bound_spent` is `conservation_holds` at that cell.
    `emitted_linkHolds` proves the abstract `ShieldedValueLinkPin.linkHolds` holds by construction for
    the emitted realization — the deployed-omitted conjunct is a theorem here.

## Scope (honest) — the named residual for the rest of the port

This lane closes the MEMBERSHIP-root-pin + VALUE-link security core. NOT closed (the next lanes):
the nullifier soundness end-to-end (C4 is proved as a row-0 hash relation in `spend_relation_row0`
but its double-spend-set discharge lives in `ShieldedTransferStark`/`Satisfied2U`); the ℤ-integer
range lift of the mod-p conservation (`VALUE_BITS` bit-decomposition, the `2^VALUE_BITS` amount cap);
the PQ / wide-commitment #17 (the deployed 1-felt ~31-bit digests + the Ristretto conservation cut);
the ∀-leaf `NoteAccumulatorCR` floor (the deferred multi-row Merkle fold-walk that recomposes the
per-row AIR chain into `foldPath` + Poseidon2 collision-resistance); and the Rust producer/emit
wiring + VK regen (`Effect::Custom` carrier, descriptor-JSON golden regen, apex fold supplying the
committed-root PI).

## Axiom hygiene

Bridge theorems over the two emitted objects; no new descriptor, no deployed-code touch. Crypto
floors enter as NAMED hypotheses (`ChipTableSound` — the chip AIR's own faithfulness; the
`NoteAccumulatorCR` ∀-leaf floor), never as axioms. `#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice,
Quot.sound}. NEW file; imports read-only.

`(value, asset, owner, randomness)` — the emitted AIR's C6 shape

`ShieldedMerkleRootPin.IsCommitted` at the emitted site.

⚠ **CORRECTED 2026-07-24 — this predicate is an ∃-IMAGE and is VACUOUS at the deployed parameters.**
The docstring it replaces called it *"NON-VACUOUS: not every field element is a note commitment"*.
That is false of a real Poseidon2: the C6 site has FOUR free field inputs onto a ~2^31 codomain, so it
is expected to be surjective mod p, and then `IsCommittedNote hash leaf` holds of EVERY leaf —
`ShieldedOnRampPin.isCommittedNote_of_c6Surjective` /
`noteAccumulatorCR_vacuous_of_c6Surjective:363`, abstracted as `Verify.ExistsImageVacuity`
§1. Counting can never refute that surjectivity (`counting_is_silent_when_domain_dominates`), so the
predicate must be read as carrying NO exclusion power on its own.

The two things that DO carry content, and where each lives:

  * **the OPENING is pinned to the trace's own cells** — `OpensAs` below. That is what the emitted AIR
    actually forces (`emitted_leaf_opensAs_row0`), and it is strictly stronger than the ∃-image
    (`isCommittedNote_does_not_pin_the_opening`): the cells it names are the same cells the nullifier
    (C4) and the value-link (C7a) consume, so the opening cannot be an unrelated witness.
  * **AUTHORIZATION** — `ShieldedOnRampPin.IsLedgerNote:237`, `∃ n, auth n ∧ leaf ≡ noteLeaf hash n`.
    This AIR does NOT force it and cannot: nothing in a satisfying trace mentions any ledger gate. It
    is supplied by the ACCUMULATOR side (the Shield-A append, `shieldAppend_is_ledger_note`), and it
    reaches a spend through the floor of `pin_accept_is_note` below. -/

its row-0 claim lane is that same PI, and the claim-root slot cannot decouple from the committed root.
This is exactly what `ShieldedMerkleRootPin.deployed_admits_but_pin_rejects` said the DEPLOYED

hypothesis is discharged for the accepted instance.
