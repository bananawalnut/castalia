# Dregg2.Circuit.RecursiveAggregation — RECURSIVE-AGGREGATION SOUNDNESS (magnesium → gold).

**The headline.** A light client that verifies ONE succinct aggregate proof — and re-witnesses
NOTHING of the history — learns that the WHOLE chain of N finalized turns is correct:
every turn executed correctly per the verified executor, the chain is correctly ordered (no
reorder/drop/insert), and the final root is the genuine fold of the whole history. This is the model
that the IVC accumulator (`circuit/src/ivc_turn_chain.rs::prove_turn_chain_recursive` →
`WholeChainProof`) realizes; `verify_turn_chain_recursive` checks only the root, cost independent of N.

**Why proofs are ADDITIVE ATTESTATION here, and that is the POINT.** The light client does NOT
re-execute the history, does NOT re-hash the states, does NOT walk the blocklace. It checks the
succinct aggregate. The aggregate's validity, UNDER the named soundness hypotheses below, IS exactly
`HistoryAggregation.WellFormedChain` (`aggregate_attests_whole_history`) — so trusting the aggregate
is trusting the whole history. The verification IS the trust.

**What is PROVED vs. what is a NAMED, REALIZABLE hypothesis (the boundary).** You cannot prove
plonky3/pickles FRI-recursion soundness in Lean — it is the soundness of a concrete Rust prover over
a concrete field. So we NAME the three soundness facts the recursion engine supplies, as `structure`
fields the headline takes as hypotheses (each realizable: it is the standard SNARK soundness of a
fixed verifier circuit, which `DESIGN-recursion-aggregation-private-joint-turns.md` §H1 argues is a
BOUNDED obligation for plonky3's single fixed verifier AIR + differential testing):

  * **`InnerProofSound`** — an inner whole-turn step proof that VERIFIES attests the verified executor
    ran that turn (`recCexec pre turn = some post`). This is the EffectVm/descriptor
    circuit⟺executor soundness, ALREADY proved per-effect in Lean (`WholeTurnTriangle`,
    `EffectVmEmit*`) — here lifted to the leaf-proof boundary as the realized hypothesis the
    recursion engine carries up.
  * **`BindingAirSound`** — a `TurnChainBindingAir` leaf proof that VERIFIES attests the temporal
    tooth `new_root[i] == old_root[i+1]` over the whole chain (`HistoryAggregation.ChainBound`). The
    AIR's continuity constraint is `ivc_turn_chain.rs:246`; its in-circuit soundness is what the leaf
    proof's verification delivers.
  * **`RecursiveVerifierSound`** — an AGGREGATE proof that VERIFIES attests EVERY wrapped child leaf
    proof verifies. This is the recursion engine's in-circuit verifier (`verify_p3_batch_proof_circuit`
    run as a circuit, `prove_aggregation_layer`) being sound — the ONE big FRI obligation (§H1), the
    part outside Lean.

EVERYTHING ELSE — that these three, COMPOSED, yield the full `WellFormedChain` attestation, and hence
the whole-history correctness + conservation — is PROVED here in Lean, gap-free. The composition is
the load-bearing content: it is where a real aggregation bug (verify proof-of-step-7 but export
step-3's roots; swap a leg; drop a turn) would HAVE to show up, and the proof shows the named
hypotheses leave no such gap.

`#assert_axioms`-clean (⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}). The named
hypotheses are `structure` FIELDS, not axioms — they appear in the theorem statements, witnessed
non-vacuously (§5: a realizing instance exists). Verified with
`lake build Dregg2.Circuit.RecursiveAggregation`.

/-! ## 0. The SNARK proof object + verifier (opaque carriers).

`Proof` is an abstract STARK/recursion proof (the `RecursionCompatibleProof` /
`RecursionOutput` of `plonky3_recursion_impl`). `verify` is the native verifier
(`verify_recursive_batch_proof`). We treat them as opaque — the WHOLE point is that the light client
calls `verify` and nothing else. Soundness of `verify` w.r.t. the protocol is supplied by the named
hypotheses; we never inspect a proof's internals. -/

/-! ## 1. The aggregate artifact — the light client's whole view.

`Aggregate` is the `WholeChainProof` (`ivc_turn_chain.rs:430`): the single root recursion proof, plus
the PUBLIC commitments it exposes — `genesisRoot`, `finalRoot`, `chainDigest`, `numTurns`. The light
client sees ONLY these public values + the root proof; it does NOT see the chain's steps or states.
The `leafProofs` / `bindingProof` are the children the engine folded; they live INSIDE the prover and
are reachable to the LIGHT CLIENT only through `RecursiveVerifierSound` (it learns they verify, not
their contents). -/

/-- The succinct aggregate the light client verifies. `root` is the single folded recursion proof;
the four public commitments are exactly the `WholeChainProof` fields. The `leafProofs` are the per-turn
whole-turn proofs and `bindingProof` the chain-binding leaf — folded into `root`. -/

/-! ## 2. The named, realizable soundness hypotheses (the boundary).

These are the three facts the recursion engine supplies that we CANNOT prove in Lean (FRI/recursion
soundness). They are bundled in `EngineSound` as a hypothesis the headline takes — NOT an axiom. The
section variables `CH RH cmb compress compressN` are the §8 commitment portal `HistoryAggregation`
uses; an `Aggregate` is interpreted against a concrete chain `steps` from genesis `g`. -/

variable (compressN : List ℤ → ℤ)

/-- **`EngineSound agg g steps`** — the three named recursion-soundness hypotheses, interpreted
against the concrete chain `steps` from genesis `g`. Realizable (§5 exhibits an instance) and
NON-vacuous. -/
structure EngineSound (agg : Aggregate Proof) (g : RecChainedState) (steps : List ChainStep) : Prop where
  /-- **H-RECURSE (`RecursiveVerifierSound`)** — if the root aggregate verifies, then every child leaf
  AND the binding leaf verify. The recursion engine's in-circuit verifier soundness (the ONE FRI
  obligation, §H1). This is the only hypothesis outside Lean's reach. -/
  recursive_sound : verify agg.root = true →
    (∀ p ∈ agg.leafProofs, verify p = true) ∧ verify agg.bindingProof = true
  /-- **H-LEAF (`InnerProofSound`)** — the leaf proofs are PAIRED POSITIONALLY with the chain steps
  (`Forall₂` ⇒ same length, same order — the binding that defeats leg-swap/drop), and each verifying
  leaf proof attests ITS paired step's verified-executor transition `recCexec pre turn = some post`.
  The EffectVm/descriptor circuit⟺executor soundness, lifted to the leaf boundary. The positional
  pairing is load-bearing: a leaf is bound to its OWN step, so a proof of turn `j` cannot satisfy the
  `i`-th leaf. -/

    (fun (p : Proof) (s : ChainStep) => verify p = true → recCexec s.pre s.turn = some s.post)
    agg.leafProofs steps
  /-- **H-BIND (`BindingAirSound`)** — a verifying `TurnChainBindingAir` leaf attests the temporal
  tooth over the whole chain (`ChainBound`), AND pins the public genesis/final roots to the chain's
  endpoints. The chain-binding AIR's in-circuit soundness. -/
  binding_sound : verify agg.bindingProof = true →
    ChainBound CH RH cmb compress compressN steps
      ∧ agg.genesisRoot = (match steps.head? with
          | none   => stateRoot CH RH cmb compress compressN g.kernel zeroTurn
          | some s => ChainStep.oldRoot CH RH cmb compress compressN s)
      ∧ agg.finalRoot = foldedFinalRoot CH RH cmb compress compressN g steps

/-! ## 3. THE LIGHT-CLIENT HEADLINE — verifying the aggregate attests the WHOLE history.

The light client runs `verify agg.root` and NOTHING ELSE. We prove: if that one check passes (and the
engine is sound, the named hypotheses), then EVERY turn in the history executed correctly, the chain
is correctly ordered, and the final root is the genuine fold of the whole history. No re-witnessing. -/

/-- Helper: from a positional pairing `Forall₂ (fun p s => verify p → executed s) ps ss` and the
fact that ALL paired proofs verify, every step executed. Induction on the `Forall₂` witness with the
"all verify" premise generalized. -/

    · exact hps (hall p (List.mem_cons_self))
    · exact ih (fun q hq => hall q (List.mem_cons_of_mem p hq)) a hrest

/-- **`every_leaf_verifies_implies_executed`.** From the recursion-soundness + leaf-soundness
hypotheses, a verifying root implies every step's verified-executor transition holds. The chain of
in-circuit verifications collapses to "every turn executed correctly" — `recursive_sound` (root ⇒
leaves verify) composed with `leaf_sound` (positional pairing ⇒ each step executed). -/
theorem every_leaf_verifies_implies_executed
    (agg : Aggregate Proof) (g : RecChainedState) (steps : List ChainStep)

  obtain ⟨hleaves, _hbind⟩ := es.recursive_sound hroot
  exact forall₂_all_verify_executed Proof verify es.leaf_sound hleaves

/-- **`AggregateAttests agg g steps`** — the full attestation the light client obtains: every turn
executed correctly, the chain is correctly ordered, the whole chain is a verified-executor `Run` from
genesis, and the public roots are pinned to the genuine endpoints. This is `WellFormedChain`'s
content, delivered to a client that checked ONLY the succinct root. -/

  /-- (1) every turn executed correctly per the verified executor. -/

      | some s => ChainStep.oldRoot CH RH cmb compress compressN s)

/-- **`light_client_verifies_whole_history` (THE MAGNESIUM→GOLD HEADLINE).**

A light client that checks ONLY `verify agg.root = true` (re-witnessing NOTHING) obtains
`AggregateAttests`: every turn executed correctly, the chain is correctly ordered (no reorder/drop/
insert), and the public final root is the genuine fold of the whole history — UNDER the named,
realizable engine-soundness hypotheses. The verification of the succinct aggregate IS the trust in
the whole history; proofs are additive attestation, and this theorem is exactly that statement,
gap-free. -/
theorem light_client_verifies_whole_history
    (agg : Aggregate Proof) (g : RecChainedState) (steps : List ChainStep)
    (es : EngineSound Proof verify CH RH cmb compress compressN agg g steps)

    , ordered := hbound
    , final_is_genuine_fold := hfin
    , genesis_pinned := hgen }

/-! ## 4. The RUN + CONSERVATION the light client inherits (no re-execution).

`AggregateAttests` gives the per-step executor transitions + the ordering; composed with state-level
continuity (the strong form the root tooth recovers under CR, `HistoryAggregation.root_tooth_pins_-
state`), it yields a full `Run recChainedSystem` from genesis, hence conservation over the WHOLE
history — all WITHOUT the light client re-running a single turn. We expose the run + conservation
directly from the `StateChained` witness the prover supplies (the chain's executor genuineness), which
the aggregate attests is consistent with the verified leaves. -/

/-- **`attested_history_is_run`.** Given the executor-genuine chain (`StateChained` — the
prover's witness that the steps are a real run, which the verifying leaves attest step-by-step), the
whole attested history is a `Run recChainedSystem` from genesis to the folded endpoint. The light
client inherits every run-level theorem of the verified record cell.

NOTE (the run vs conservation split): a full `Run recChainedSystem` is a relation on `RecChainedState`
configs, so composing the steps requires the receipt LOG to chain (`s.post = s'.pre`), which the §8
state commitment does NOT bind (it commits the kernel, not the log). The full `Run` therefore genuinely
needs `StateChained`. CONSERVATION, by contrast, reads only the kernel — so it is derivable from the
VERIFIED root without `StateChained`; that is `conserves_from_verification` below (the CRITICAL-3
closure). The log being uncommitted is the exact, named residual: it blocks the full RUN, never
conservation. -/
theorem attested_history_is_run
    (g : RecChainedState) (steps : List ChainStep) (hch : StateChained g steps) :
    Run recChainedSystem g (lastStateOf g steps) :=
  wellformed_is_run g steps hch

/-- **`attested_history_conserves` (KEYSTONE).** Value is conserved across the WHOLE attested
history: the ledger total at the folded endpoint equals the genesis total. A light client trusting the
aggregate trusts a no-mint/no-burn history of arbitrary length, having re-executed nothing. Rides
`HistoryAggregation.wellformed_history_conserves`.

This form takes `StateChained` as a hypothesis (the legitimate producer-supplied path —
`Argus/Aggregate.lean` DERIVES `StateChained` from the genuine producer run). The verification-derived
form that needs NO such hypothesis is `conserves_from_verification` below. -/
theorem attested_history_conserves
    (g : RecChainedState) (steps : List ChainStep) (hch : StateChained g steps) :
    recTotal (lastStateOf g steps).kernel = recTotal g.kernel :=
  wellformed_history_conserves g steps hch

/-! ### CRITICAL-3 CLOSURE — conservation-over-history DERIVED from `verify agg.root`, no `StateChained`.

The critique: `attested_history_conserves` takes `StateChained` (state continuity) as a SEPARATE
prover-supplied hypothesis — exactly what a malicious prover controls — and the tool that could close
it (`root_tooth_pins_state`) recovered only commitment-equality, not state-equality. We close it:
the strengthened `HistoryAggregation.root_tooth_pins_kernel` recovers KERNEL-equality from the verified
root tooth (under the standard Poseidon CR set + the preserved `AccountsWF` invariant), and
`verified_history_conserves` rides that to conservation through `KernelChained` — so conservation
follows from `verify agg.root` itself (which delivers the `ChainBound` tooth via `AggregateAttests`),
plus the genesis pin + the non-cryptographic structural envelope `SeamStruct`. The `StateChained`
hypothesis is GONE from the conservation headline. -/

/-- **`conserves_from_verification` (THE CRITICAL-3 HEADLINE — conservation from `verify agg.root`).**
A light client that checks ONLY `verify agg.root = true` (re-witnessing NOTHING) learns the WHOLE
history conserves value — the ledger total at the folded endpoint equals the genesis total — with NO
`StateChained` hypothesis. The verified root gives `AggregateAttests` (hence the `ChainBound` root
tooth); under the standard Poseidon CR set + the genesis pin + the structural envelope `SeamStruct`
(matched turns + the preserved `AccountsWF` invariant, both non-cryptographic, neither a
state-continuity assertion), `verified_history_conserves` DERIVES kernel continuity from that tooth
(`root_tooth_pins_kernel`) and rides it to conservation. This is the exact gap the critique flagged,
closed: "trusting the aggregate trusts a no-mint/no-burn history" now follows from VERIFICATION, not
from the prover's honesty about state continuity. (The receipt LOG — the one `RecChainedState`
component the §8 root does not bind — blocks only the full `Run`, never conservation; named, not
hidden.) -/

/-! ## 5. NON-VACUITY — the named hypotheses are REALIZABLE (witnessed BOTH ways).

The headline would be hollow if `EngineSound` were unsatisfiable, or if `verify agg.root = true`
could not occur. We exhibit a CONCRETE realizing instance over the `HistoryAggregation.honestStep`
chain (a real 1-step executor run over the teeth genesis): a `verify` that accepts, an `Aggregate`
whose root/leaf/binding all verify, and an `EngineSound` proof — so the headline fires on a real
chain and concludes a real `AggregateAttests`. We ALSO witness the negative: a `verify` that REJECTS
gives a vacuously-true `EngineSound` (no obligation), and the headline is not invoked — the tooth is
in the `binding_sound`/`leaf_sound` implications, which §6 shows separate honest from
tampered. -/

/-! ## 6. THE ANTI-GHOST TOOTH — the named hypotheses REJECT a tampered aggregate.

Additive attestation is only meaningful if the aggregate cannot attest a BROKEN history. The teeth:
(a) the binding soundness CANNOT certify a reordered chain — if the steps' seam roots disagree,
`ChainBound` is FALSE, so any `EngineSound` whose `binding_sound` fires on such a chain is
CONTRADICTORY (you cannot have a verifying binding proof for a broken order). (b) the leaf↔step
PAIRING (`leaf_sound`'s length+index discipline) defeats leg-swap/drop: a leaf proof is bound to its
OWN step's `(pre, turn, post)`, so you cannot verify proof-of-turn-j against step-i. -/

attest a REORDERED 2-step chain. If the first step's `newRoot` differs from the second's `oldRoot`
(a spliced/reordered/dropped turn — the `TurnChainError::ChainBreak` condition), then for ANY engine
whose binding leaf verifies, `binding_sound` would force `ChainBound [s, s']`, which is FALSE for a
broken order. Hence the engine cannot have a verifying binding proof over a tampered chain — the
aggregate REJECTS reorder/drop/insert. -/

/-- **`leaf_pairing_defeats_swap` (the leg-swap tooth).** A verifying leaf proof attests the
transition of ITS OWN POSITIONALLY-PAIRED step, not some other turn's. The `leaf_sound` `Forall₂`
binds the head leaf `p` to the head step `s`: if `p` verifies, the executor ran `s`'s
`(pre, turn) ↦ post`. An adversary cannot satisfy the head leaf by supplying a proof of a DIFFERENT
turn while exporting `s`'s roots — the leaf is bound to `s` by the positional pairing, not re-pointable.
This is the recursion analog of the per-effect anti-ghost. -/

/-! ## 7. THE UNBOUNDED IVC ACCUMULATOR — the running left-fold, proven by induction from genesis.

§§1–6 prove the FLAT statement: given a `WholeChainProof` over a *finite* K-turn window, verifying its
root attests `WellFormedChain` for that window. That is the BOUNDED-K light client (`ivc_turn_chain.rs::
prove_turn_chain_recursive`, a balanced binary tree over K leaves).

This section proves the part Mina LACKS: that the accumulator can be driven as a CONTINUOUS LEFT-FOLD
(`acc_n = accumulate(acc_{n-1}, turn_n)`), extending the attested history ONE step at a time, with O(1)
memory (keep only `acc_{n-1}`), and that the running accumulator's attestation is PRESERVED at every
step — so by induction from genesis, `acc_n` attests the WHOLE history `0..n`. This is the IVC soundness
INDUCTION as a Lean theorem:

  `accumulate_preserves_wellformed` — IF `acc` attests `WellFormedChain g steps` AND the next turn `s`
  is executor-sound (a `ChainStep`, so `s.commits` is built in) and STATE-EXTENDS the head
  (`s.pre = lastStateOf g steps`), THEN `accumulate acc s` attests `WellFormedChain g (steps ++ [s])`.

  `acc_attests_whole_history` — folding `accumulate` from the genesis accumulator over a state-extending
  stream yields an accumulator attesting `WellFormedChain g (the whole stream)`. The base case is the
  empty chain (trivially well-formed); the step is `accumulate_preserves_wellformed`.

This is the SOUNDNESS SKELETON of the unbounded online accumulator. The CRYPTO carrier (the running
recursion proof re-verified in-circuit so `acc_n.proof` has the SAME shape `acc_{n+1}` can verify — the
IVC fixed point) is the SAME named, realizable `EngineSound` boundary §2 already carries; nothing new is
axiomatized. What this section adds OVER §§1–6 is the INDUCTIVE characterization: the flat headline is
re-derived as the n-th unfolding of a one-step-at-a-time fold from genesis.

NOTE on the seam (the genuinely-load-bearing hypothesis, named not hidden). `accumulate` extends a chain
at its HEAD; for the *root-level* temporal tooth (`ChainBound`) to extend, the new step's `oldRoot` must
equal the previous last step's `newRoot`. We DERIVE that from state continuity (`s.pre = lastStateOf …`)
via `seam_roots_chain` (state-chaining ENTAILS the root tooth, the "honest accumulator never asserts the
tooth separately" direction) under the seam turn-context match — the same `hturn` the §5 CR recovery
carries. State continuity is the producer's witness (exactly as `StateChained` is everywhere here); the
tooth is then FREE, not a second assumption. -/

/-! ### Snoc lemmas — extending each chain predicate by one step at the TAIL.

`accumulate` appends `s` at the END (`steps ++ [s]`). The chain predicates (`StateChained`, `ChainBound`,
`lastStateOf`) are defined by recursion on the HEAD, so extending at the tail needs these three snoc
lemmas, each a straightforward list induction. They are the load-bearing combinatorial content of the
IVC step: dropping/reordering at the tail would break exactly one of them. -/

old head (`s.pre = lastStateOf g steps`). -/

/-- **`accumulate acc s hseam hturn`** — the running left-fold step. Given the running accumulator
`acc` (attesting `WellFormedChain g acc.steps`) and the next executor-sound turn `s` (a `ChainStep`, so
`s.commits` is built in) that STATE-EXTENDS the head (`hseam : s.pre = acc.head`) under a matched seam
turn-context (`hturn`), produce `acc'` attesting `WellFormedChain g (acc.steps ++ [s])`. O(1) view: the
prover keeps only `acc` (its running proof); `acc.steps` is the SPEC the proof attests, extended by one.

The two invariants are re-established by the snoc lemmas:
  * STATE continuity (`stateChained_snoc`) from `hseam`;
  * the ROOT temporal tooth (`chainBound_snoc`) — and the NEW seam `Continues last s` is DERIVED from
    `hseam` (state continuity) via `seam_roots_chain`, so the tooth is FREE, never a second assumption. -/

genesis over `acc.steps`, for ANY accumulator reachable from `genesisAcc` by `accumulate` steps. We
state it as: every `Acc` (which can only be built by `genesisAcc` + `accumulate`, both of which
maintain the invariant) carries the whole-history attestation in its `leanWitness`. Composed with
`light_client_verifies_whole_history` (§3) — whose `EngineSound` is sound for exactly this
`WellFormedChain` — a light client verifying the running root learns the whole accumulated history is
correct, ordered, and genuinely folded. This is the unbounded IVC soundness, by induction from genesis,
with the recursion-engine boundary unchanged. -/

re-executed nothing and held O(1) memory. -/

/-! ### IVC non-vacuity — the accumulator FIRES on a real chain (genesis → one accumulate step).

The induction would be hollow if no real `accumulate` step could fire. We build `genesisAcc` over the
teeth genesis and `accumulate` the honest step into it, getting a length-1 accumulator whose witness is
a REAL `WellFormedChain`, and read off its conservation (the `100` supply). So the IVC step is inhabited
on a genuine executor run, not an empty implication. -/

/-! ## 9. THE ORDERED SEGMENT-ACCUMULATOR — the whole-chain binding DERIVED, not assumed.

§§1–8 took the whole-chain ordered binding as a NAMED hypothesis: `EngineSound.binding_sound` asserts
a verifying `TurnChainBindingAir` leaf delivers `ChainBound` + the genesis/final pins, and
`acc_attests_whole_history` then PROJECTS the attestation off the `Acc.leanWitness` the prover stored.
That is exactly the mixed-root hole codex's segment-accumulator fix closes BY CONSTRUCTION
(`docs/CODEX-IVC-SEGMENT-ACCUMULATOR-DESIGN.md`): every descriptor/execution leaf — and every
aggregation node — carries a constant-size ordered SEGMENT summary `Seg = (firstOld, lastNew, count,
acc)`; a node combines its children with state-continuity (`L.lastNew = R.firstOld`), count additivity,
and an ORDERED Poseidon2 digest `acc = H(L.acc, R.acc)`; the host checks the root's exposed segment
equals the carried claim. The Rust verifier enforces this (`ivc_turn_chain.rs:224/1963`, codex
`CODEX-IVC-FINAL-REVIEW.md` — the mixed-root forgery REJECTS). Here we DERIVE — no longer assume — that
a verifying segment tree's root claim IS the genuine ordered segment-summary of the EXECUTED leaves.

THREE soundness layers, cleanly separated (codex `docs/CODEX-DISCHARGE-SKELETON.md`):

  * **`SegSound` (LAYER-1 — the per-node FRI/STARK crypto floor, ASSUMED, realizable).** Provides ONLY
    *local* statement soundness: a verifying LEAF node's exposed segment is its genuine leaf-segment
    (and its turn executed); a verifying COMBINE node's children verify and its exposed segment
    satisfies the local `CombineOk` constraint w.r.t. the children's exposed segments. This is the
    `EngineSound` boundary §2 already carries, refined to per-node and kept STRICTLY LOCAL — it does NOT
    mention `GenuineSeg`, `ChainBound`, or the whole history. (The leaf's executor witness is in fact
    free: a `ChainStep` bakes `commits`.)

  * **`subtree_binding` (LAYER-2 — THE DISCHARGE, DERIVED).** By induction on the aggregation tree, a
    verifying subtree's exposed segment is the genuine ordered segment-summary (`GenuineSeg`) of the
    leaves under it. BASE = a verifying leaf (LAYER-1 ⇒ exposed = leaf-segment). STEP = a verifying
    combine node (LAYER-1 ⇒ children verify + `CombineOk`; the children's `GenuineSeg` by IH; the
    `CombineOk` fields force the parent = the ordered concatenation). From `GenuineSeg` we DERIVE the
    whole-chain facts the §2 binding leaf used to ASSUME: `genuine_count`, `genuine_ordered`
    (`ChainBound` over the WHOLE leaf list — exactly `WellFormedChain.bound`/`binding_sound`),
    `genuine_firstOld`/`genuine_lastNew` (genesis = first leaf's old root, final = last leaf's new root).
    THIS is the ordered-binding discharge — `ordered_binding_derived` + `segment_tree_wellformed`
    produce `WellFormedChain.bound` from the segment construction, no longer as a hypothesis.

  * **`PoseidonSegBinding` (LAYER-3 — the digest collision-resistance crypto floor, ASSUMED,
    realizable).** Semantic uniqueness of the ordered digest: equal `acc` ⇒ equal ordered leaf
    sequence. The DISTINCT-ENDPOINT mixed-root forgery (B's claim has a different genesis/final than A's
    executed leaves) is rejected with NO appeal to this floor — `subtree_binding` forces the endpoints
    (`no_mixed_root_distinct_endpoint`). The SAME-ENDPOINT case (B's claim shares A's endpoints but a
    different interior leaf sequence) reduces to a Poseidon2 collision; that is the 4-lane W24 digest CR
    codex confirmed the close rests on (`CODEX-IVC-FINAL-REVIEW.md`). Named here as the terminal crypto
    floor it is (`no_mixed_root`) — NOT a hole, NOT something Lean can discharge.

So the whole-chain ORDERED binding moves from ASSUMED (`binding_sound`) to DERIVED (`subtree_binding` +
`GenuineSeg` corollaries); only the per-node proof soundness (LAYER-1) and the digest CR (LAYER-3)
remain as the two NAMED, realizable crypto floors. `#assert_axioms`-clean. -/

/-! ### §9 NON-VACUITY — the discharge FIRES on a real 2-leaf executor chain.

The induction would be hollow if no genuine combine node could fire. We build a REAL 2-step chain from
the teeth genesis (two honest transfers of 10), expose its genuine segments, and prove `SegSound` holds
with the accepting status — so `subtree_binding` concludes a genuine `GenuineSeg` over the two executed
leaves, and `ordered_binding_derived` delivers a REAL `ChainBound` over them. The combine node's
state-continuity holds DEFINITIONALLY (the second step consumes the first's post under the same
turn-context), exactly the seam the segment-accumulator binds. -/

/-! ## 10. THE RUNNING-VK FIXED POINT — perpetual constancy MECHANIZED (the depth-invariance induction).

§§1–9 prove the whole-history ATTESTATION is preserved by the unbounded fold. They are SILENT on the
SHAPE of the running recursion proof's verifying key — the property a LIGHT CLIENT needs to pin ONE
trust anchor and accept an accumulated chain of ANY length: that the running VK is CONSTANT across fold
depth. `circuit-prove/src/accumulator.rs` MEASURES this (`wrapped_running_vk_is_constant_across_depth`):
the running aggregation VK settles to a fixed point at depth 4 (after a finite 2-step transient) and is
BYTE-IDENTICAL from there — `rows`, `degree_bits`, AND the preprocessed commitment all equal at depth 4
and depth 5. The "perpetual" half — `∀N, VK_N = VK_4` — used to rest on a PROSE structural-idempotence
argument. THIS SECTION MECHANIZES it.

The mechanization, tiered by what each part rests on (honest):

  * **The fold-shape transition is a deterministic function of SHAPE ALONE — `step : VkShape → VkShape`.**
    The parent aggregation circuit's op-list (hence its preprocessed commitment = the VK core) is built
    by `verify_p3_batch_proof_circuit` (the recursion fork) from ONLY the running input proof's SHAPE
    quantities — its `rows`, `table_packing`, the `non_primitives` op_type/rows/lanes manifest, and the
    per-instance public-value COUNTS (`entry.public_values.len()`, a count, never the values). The
    witness VALUES never enter the op-list, and `recursion_vk_fingerprint` (the impl) is correspondingly
    content-independent ("two proofs of the same circuit shape over different data fingerprint
    identically"). So the running VK at depth n+1 is a FUNCTION of the running VK at depth n and the
    constant leaf shape — modeled here as `step`. Modeling the transition as a FUNCTION of `VkShape`
    (not a relation over proofs) is precisely the encoding of that discharged fact. (Discharge: the fork
    code-audit + the value-independence Rust tooth `running_vk_fixed_point_is_value_independent` — two
    DIFFERENT value-streams reach the SAME depth-4 VK material.)

  * **The depth-4 VK is a FIXED POINT of `step` — `hfix : step anchor = anchor`.** MEASURED:
    `wrapped_running_vk_is_constant_across_depth` shows the full VK material is byte-identical at depth 4
    and depth 5 — i.e. one application of `step` to the depth-4 shape reproduces it exactly.

  * **THEREFORE the running VK is PERPETUALLY CONSTANT past depth 4** — `running_vk_perpetually_constant`:
    `∀ n, step^[n] anchor = anchor`. This is the deterministic-iteration induction the prose argument
    named, now machine-checked. A light client pins the ONE depth-4 anchor and EVERY deeper running proof
    carries it (`running_vk_one_anchor`).

The remaining recursion-fork work is NOT this perpetual claim (mechanized here): it is shrinking the
finite 2-step TRANSIENT (depths 2,3, before the fixed point) to zero, so every fold from the FIRST
aggregation already carries the one anchor. That needs a CANONICAL agg-shaped SEED whose own left is
agg-shaped (the Pickles step∘wrap identity/normalize fold) — a primitive the fork exposes none of today.
The transient is a USABILITY uniformity, NOT a soundness gate: the VK-identity pin TRACKS the running
commitment through it (honest transient folds are not rejected), and a light client anchors on the
perpetual fixed-point VK. -/

section RunningVkFixedPoint

/-! The running recursion proof's verifying-key SHAPE (`VkShape`) — the full verifier-reconstruction
material the `recursion_vk_fingerprint` hashes (table packing, `rows`, `degree_bits`, the non-primitive
manifest, and the preprocessed commitment = the op-list / VK core). Opaque here: the theorem speaks to
its TRANSITION across folds, not its internals.

`step` is the fold-shape transition: the VK shape of the running proof at depth n+1 as a DETERMINISTIC
function of the VK shape at depth n (the leaf shape being constant). That this is a function of SHAPE
ALONE — not of the witness values — is the fork's content-independence (the verifier op-list is built
from the input proof's shape quantities only); modeling it as `VkShape → VkShape` encodes exactly that
discharged fact. -/
variable {VkShape : Type}
variable (step : VkShape → VkShape)

/-- **`running_vk_iterate_fixed` (the deterministic-iteration core).** Iterating a deterministic map
from a fixed point stays at the fixed point — `Mathlib.Function.iterate_fixed`. The pure-math backbone
of perpetual constancy: the depth-4 shape is reproduced by every further fold. -/
theorem running_vk_iterate_fixed {a : VkShape} (hfix : step a = a) :
    ∀ n, step^[n] a = a :=
  fun n => Function.iterate_fixed hfix n

/-- **`running_vk_perpetually_constant` (THE DEPTH-INVARIANCE HEADLINE).** Given the MEASURED depth-4
fixed point (`hfix : step anchor = anchor` — the byte-identical depth-4 == depth-5 VK material), the
running VK at EVERY depth past 4 — `step^[n] anchor`, the n-th fold beyond the fixed point — equals the
depth-4 anchor. So `∀N, VK_N = VK_4`: a fixed-size verifier forever, no longer a prose idempotence
argument but a machine-checked induction off ONE measured fixed point. -/
theorem running_vk_perpetually_constant {anchor : VkShape} (hfix : step anchor = anchor) :
    ∀ n, step^[n] anchor = anchor :=
  running_vk_iterate_fixed step hfix

/-- **`running_vk_one_anchor` (the light-client single-anchor property).** Any two running proofs at or
past the fixed point carry the IDENTICAL VK shape — so a light client pins ONE anchor and accepts an
accumulated chain of ANY length. -/
theorem running_vk_one_anchor {anchor : VkShape} (hfix : step anchor = anchor) (m n : Nat) :
    step^[m] anchor = step^[n] anchor := by

/-! ### §10 NON-VACUITY — the fixed-point induction FIRES on a concrete transient + fixed point.

The mechanization would be hollow if no transition with a genuine transient AND a reachable fixed point
existed. We model exactly the measured shape: a transition that INCREMENTS through a transient (depths
0,1,2,3) and CLAMPS at 4 (the depth-4 fixed point), then fire the perpetual-constancy theorem off the
anchor — and witness the transient is REAL (depth 0 ≠ depth 4), the A/B companion of
`wrap_grows_vk_when_disabled`. -/

theorem real_running_vk_fixed : realStep 4 = 4 := by decide

/-- **`real_running_vk_perpetual` (the headline WITNESSED).** The perpetual-constancy theorem fires:
from the witnessed fixed point, every iterate equals the anchor — a real, non-vacuous instance of the
depth-invariance induction (`∀N, VK_N = VK_4`). -/
theorem real_running_vk_perpetual : ∀ n, realStep^[n] 4 = 4 :=
  running_vk_perpetually_constant realStep real_running_vk_fixed

/-- **`real_running_vk_transient_is_real` (the non-vacuity A/B half).** The modeled transition genuinely
MOVES through the transient before settling: the depth-0 shape differs from the depth-4 shape
(`realStep^[4] 0 = 4 ≠ 0`). So the fixed-point equality asserted above is LOAD-BEARING (the early shapes
really differ), exactly as the Rust `wrap_grows_vk_when_disabled` confirms the measured transient is
real. -/
