# Dregg2.Circuit.RotatedKernelRefinementFacetTurnBound — the TURN-IDENTITY binding (the smuggle close).

## The hole this module closes

`RotatedKernelRefinementFacet` lands the faithful authority leg, but the apex
(`lightclient_turn_unfoolable_forest_facet` / `lightclient_transfer_faithful`) concludes

  `∃ (tr : Turn) (a : AssetId), BalanceMovementSpecFacet fcaps provided pre tr a post`

with the kernel turn `tr` EXISTENTIALLY quantified. The authority leg of `BalanceMovementSpecFacet`
reads `authorizedFacetB fcaps provided tr` — whose OWNER disjunct is `decide (tr.actor = tr.src)` and
whose CAP disjunct opens a cap over `tr.src` for actor `tr.actor`. NONE of `tr.actor`, `tr.src`,
`tr.dst` is bound to the LIGHT CLIENT'S published commitment:

  * `recStateCommit k t` (`StateCommit.lean`) uses `t.src`/`t.dst` only as the cell-digest PARTITION
    index (`k.accounts \ {t.src, t.dst}`) and never absorbs `t.actor` at all;
  * the rotated descriptor publishes 4 PI pins (OLD/NEW commit · height · caveat commit —
    `EffectVmEmitRotationV3.rotPins`); NONE is the turn's `actor`/`src`/`dst`;
  * the cap-open columns `capOpenCols.src`/`capOpenCols.capRoot` are FREE appendix columns (no gate
    welds them to a committed before-block — `CapOpenEmit §1` documents a weld that the constraint list
    `capOpenConstraintsEff` does NOT lay down).

A light client that trusts ONLY the proof + the published `(pre, post)` therefore cannot see WHICH
turn the authority gate ran on. A prover can existentially instantiate `tr.actor := tr.src` (owner
disjunct, no cap needed) for ANY `src` it moves, and the apex's conclusion still holds — the owner
authority is entirely OFF-CIRCUIT.

## What this module forces

The published `BatchPublicInputs.turn` (`pc.turn`) IS exposed to the light client. The honest fix is
to make the kernel step's turn BE that published turn — so the authority gate (owner OR cap) runs on
the turn the light client SEES, not a free existential. This module:

  1. **`dispatchArmFacetTB fcaps provided pubTurn`** — the TURN-BOUND faithful arm: the step's turn IS
     the published `pubTurn` (no free existential `tr`). `BalanceMovementSpecFacet fcaps provided pre
     pubTurn a post` — so `authorizedFacetB fcaps provided pubTurn` reads the COMMITTED identity.

  2. **`TurnIdentityBound`** — the NAMED in-circuit binding the light client requires: the witness's
     `rotatedEncodes`/cap-open turn IS the published `pc.turn` (`tr = pc.turn`). This is what a
     turn-identity PI gate forces (the designated rows publish `(actor, src, dst, amt)` to the PI turn
     slots). It is the genuine residual the LEDGER commitment cannot carry on its own — but UNLIKE the
     prior free existential, it is now an EXPLICIT equality the apex consumes, not a hidden choice.

  3. **`ownerGateForced` / `dispatchArmFacetTB_owner`** — the OWNER disjunct made an IN-CIRCUIT decision
     over the COMMITTED turn: `decide (pc.turn.actor = pc.turn.src)`. Because the turn is now `pc.turn`
     (bound), the owner gate is a decision on PUBLISHED data — a light client CAN check it. The prior
     hole (owner-authority off-circuit) is closed: ownership is asserted of the published actor/src, not
     a free existential.

  4. **`transfer_descriptorRefines_facetTB`** — the turn-bound refinement: a satisfying value witness +
     its decode + the cap-open source + the turn-identity binding force `BalanceMovementSpecFacet fcaps
     provided pre pc.turn a post` — the authority leg over the PUBLISHED turn.

  5. **`descriptorRefinesTB`** + **`lightclient_transfer_faithful_turnbound`** — the apex re-stated so
     the conclusion's turn IS `pi.turn`: the authority a light client gets is over the turn it
     published, NOT a free one.

## Honest residual (named, not faked)

`TurnIdentityBound` is the genuine in-circuit obligation a turn-identity PI gate discharges (publish the
witness's turn fields to the PI turn slots; the gate `pi.turn = witnessTurn`). It is REALIZABLE — the
honest prover's witness IS the published turn — and it is now CARRIED EXPLICITLY (exactly as
`StarkSound`/`WitnessDecodes` are), consumed by the apex, NOT a hidden existential choice. The deployed
realization (adding the 4 turn-field PI pins + the equality gate to `rotPins`) is VK-affecting circuit
work named in the report. The Lean side — the binding made explicit + the apex re-pointed at the
published turn — is what closes the SMUGGLE: the authority is no longer over a turn the light client
cannot see.

/-! ## §1 — `TurnIdentityBound`: the published turn IS the witness's turn (the NAMED in-circuit binding).

The value witness (`rotatedEncodes`) and the cap-open source both carry a kernel turn `tr`. The light
client publishes `pc.turn`. `TurnIdentityBound pc tr` is the equality `tr = pc.turn` — the obligation a
turn-identity PI gate discharges (the designated rows publish `(actor, src, dst, amt)` into the PI turn
slots, and the gate equates them). It is the genuine residual the LEDGER commitment cannot carry on its
own (the commitment partitions on `src`/`dst` and ignores `actor`), made EXPLICIT and consumed by the
apex — not a hidden existential choice as before. -/

/-- **`TurnIdentityBound pc tr`** — the published boundary turn IS the witness's kernel turn. The
turn-identity PI binding: a light client that publishes `pc.turn` is certified that the authority gate
ran on EXACTLY that turn (`tr = pc.turn`), so the owner/cap decision is over the PUBLISHED identity. -/
def TurnIdentityBound (pc : PublishedCommit) (tr : Turn) : Prop :=
  tr = pc.turn

/-- The turn-identity binding rewrites the witness turn to the published turn. -/
theorem TurnIdentityBound.eq {pc : PublishedCommit} {tr : Turn} (h : TurnIdentityBound pc tr) :
    tr = pc.turn := h

/-! ## §2 — `dispatchArmFacetTB`: the TURN-BOUND faithful arm (no free existential turn).

`RotatedKernelRefinementFacet.dispatchArmFacet` is `∃ tr a, BalanceMovementSpecFacet … tr …` — the turn
is existential, so the authority gate `authorizedFacetB … tr` reads a turn the light client cannot see.
`dispatchArmFacetTB fcaps provided pubTurn` PINS the turn to the published `pubTurn`: only the asset is
existential. The authority leg now reads the COMMITTED published turn. -/

/-- **`dispatchArmFacetTB fcaps provided pubTurn pre post`** — the TURN-BOUND faithful transfer arm: a
faithful transfer of SOME asset `a` ON THE PUBLISHED TURN `pubTurn` (NOT a free existential). The
authority leg `authorizedFacetB fcaps provided pubTurn` reads the turn the light client published. -/

    (pre post : RecChainedState) : Prop :=
  ∃ a : AssetId, BalanceMovementSpecFacet fcaps provided pre pubTurn a post

/-- **`dispatchArmFacetTB_to_dispatchArmFacet`** — the turn-bound arm entails the existential arm (the
published turn IS a witness). So the turn-bound apex is STRONGER: it pins the existential the old apex
left free. (The converse FAILS without `TurnIdentityBound` — exactly the smuggle.) -/

  exact ⟨pubTurn, a, hspec⟩

/-! ## §3 — the OWNER gate, FORCED over the COMMITTED turn.

The prior hole: the owner disjunct `decide (tr.actor = tr.src)` ran on a free existential `tr`, so a
prover could pick `tr.actor := tr.src` for any `src` it moves — owner authority OFF-circuit. With the
turn bound to `pc.turn`, the owner gate is a decision on the PUBLISHED actor/src, which a light client
CAN inspect. `ownerGateForced` discharges the authority leg from `pc.turn.actor = pc.turn.src` over the
COMMITTED turn — the owner authority is now over published data. -/

/-- **`ownerGateForced` — the owner disjunct over the COMMITTED turn.** If the PUBLISHED turn's actor
owns its src (`pc.turn.actor = pc.turn.src`), the deployed two-axis gate PASSES on the published turn.
Because the turn is `pc.turn` (bound, not existential), this is a decision a light client makes on the
published identity — the owner authority is IN the published surface, not smuggled. -/

/-- **`dispatchArmFacetTB_owner` — the OWNER path lands the turn-bound arm over the published turn.** An
owner-authorized PUBLISHED transfer (`pc.turn.actor = pc.turn.src`) whose value movement holds lands the
turn-bound faithful arm — its authority discharged by the IN-PUBLISHED-SURFACE owner gate, NOT a free
existential. This is the owner-authority smuggle closed: the ownership is asserted of `pc.turn`. -/

/-! ## §4 — `transfer_descriptorRefines_facetTB`: the turn-bound refinement.

The faithful refinement with the turn PINNED to the published `pc.turn`. From a satisfying value
witness, its decode (whose turn is bound to `pc.turn` via `TurnIdentityBound`), and the cap-open source
OVER `pc.turn`, force `BalanceMovementSpecFacet fcaps provided pre pc.turn a post` — the authority leg
over the PUBLISHED turn. -/

/-! ## §5 — the BOTH-POLARITY tooth: the turn-bound authority bites over the PUBLISHED turn.

A PUBLISHED turn the deployed gate rejects (neither owner nor a conferring cap) has NO turn-bound
faithful arm — so the published authority is genuinely load-bearing, not vacuous. -/

/-- **`dispatchArmFacetTB_rejects_unauthorized` (the published-turn authority TOOTH).** If the deployed
two-axis gate REJECTS the PUBLISHED turn (`authorizedFacetB fcaps provided pubTurn = false` — neither
owner nor a conferring cap), then NO `(pre, post)` is a turn-bound faithful step on that turn. The
authority leg bites over the turn the light client published — an unauthorized published transfer is
rejected. -/

/-! ## §6 — the TURN-BOUND apex: the authority a light client gets is over the turn it PUBLISHED.

`descriptorRefinesTB` is the per-effect rung whose `kstep` is the TURN-BOUND arm over `pc.turn`; the
apex over it concludes the step on the PUBLISHED turn — the smuggle (authority over a free turn) closed.
The turn-identity binding `TurnIdentityBound` is consumed inside the rung (it is the named PI obligation
the rung needs to tie the witness turn to the published one). -/

/-- **`descriptorRefinesTB S hash d fcaps provided`** — the per-effect refinement whose kernel step is
the TURN-BOUND faithful arm: any satisfying witness of `d` whose published commitment `pc` decodes to
`pre`/`post` forces `dispatchArmFacetTB fcaps provided pc.turn pre post` — the faithful step ON THE
PUBLISHED TURN. The turn-identity binding lives inside the discharge (the value-rung's witness turn IS
`pc.turn`); the conclusion's turn is the light client's `pc.turn`, not a free existential. -/

/-! ## §6.R — THE REALIZATION: `hsrc` (and the src leg of `TurnIdentityBound`) DERIVED from the live
turn-identity PI weld, no longer carried.

`transfer_descriptorRefines_facetTB` carries `hbound : TurnIdentityBound pc tr` and `hauth :
TransferAuthoritySourceCanon … pc.turn` — whose `hsrc` field (`capOpenCols.src = tr.src`) is an ASSUMED
equality. `CapOpenTurnPins` REALIZES that binding in the live descriptor: `effCapOpenV3TB` publishes the
turn's `src` to a PI slot and welds the cap-open `src` column to it; the deployed verifier ANCHORS that PI
to `turn.src` (`TurnIdentityAnchored`). So a `Satisfied2` witness of the turn-pinned descriptor whose
verifier anchored `PI = turn.src` FORCES `capOpenCols.src = turn.src` — `hsrc` is now a CIRCUIT
consequence, no longer a structure field a prover supplies for a free column.

This section feeds that forced `hsrc` into the slim canonical authority source, so the transfer
refinement's authority leg rests on the OPENED LEAF's target welded to the PUBLISHED source — closing the
prover-chosen-src smuggle for the cap disjunct. -/
