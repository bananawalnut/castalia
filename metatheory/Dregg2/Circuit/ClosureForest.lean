# Dregg2.Circuit.ClosureForest — the WHOLE-TURN CLOSED apex over HETEROGENEOUS effects.

`ClosureFinal.lightclient_unfoolable_circuit_sound` proves the SINGLE-step closed apex: a verifying batch
for ONE effect ⟹ a genuine single kernel step `kstepAll pi.effect`, standing on only the realizable floors
{`StarkSound`, `Poseidon2SpongeCR` + the `S_live` CR fields, `logHashInjective`, the per-effect
`ClosedLogExtract` prover-witness floor}. The WHOLE-TURN analog is what this module lands: a verified TURN
— a LIST of HETEROGENEOUS effects, threaded as a `TurnDecodeChain` (each step's circuit `Satisfied2`,
decoded, seam-published) — ⟹ a genuine whole-turn kernel transition `execFullTurnA start acts = some fin`,
standing on the SAME realizable floors, the `ClosedLogExtract` family now QUANTIFIED OVER THE CHAIN'S STEPS
(a per-STEP family, ANY effect — NOT the transfer-only residual `hidx0` the faithful forest carried).

## What composes (the fold is already built; this module CLOSES its carried family)

`CircuitSoundness.lightclient_turn_unfoolable_forest` is the whole-turn apex over the THREADED chain. It
carries the per-effect refinement family `hrefines : ∀ e, descriptorRefines S hash (R e) (dispatchArm e)`
OPAQUELY. `CircuitSoundnessAssembled.lightclient_turn_unfoolable_forest_forest_assembled` re-states it at
`Rfix`/`kstepAll = dispatchArm`, still carrying the abstract `EffectDecodeBridge` family. This module does
to the WHOLE-TURN apex EXACTLY what `ClosureFinal.lightclient_unfoolable_circuit_sound_of_readouts` did to
the single-step apex: it BUILDS the carried per-effect refinement family from the genuine per-step
`ClosedLogExtract` family + the log floor, so the proven `RotatedKernelRefinement* … _closedLog` soundness
rungs are LOAD-BEARING behind the whole turn.

The realization chain (every rung genuinely consumed):

  * `ClosureFanoutGenuine.closedLogExtract_all_genuine rds : ∀ e, ClosedLogExtract S_live LH hash Rfix e`
    — the per-STEP/per-effect prover-witness family, discharged by the 36-way `actionTag` case split, EACH
    cohort slot CALLING its proven `<e>_closedLog` rung (the load-bearing core — `cellSeal_closedLog`,
    `revoke_closedLog`, `mint_closedLog`, …, NOT a carried opaque `∀ step, kstep`).

  * `ClosureAll.hrefinesAllClosed S_live LH hash (closedLogExtract_all_genuine rds) mkLog :
    ∀ e, descriptorRefines S_live hash (Rfix e) (kstepAll e)` — folds each step's `ClosedLogExtract` (the
    `Satisfied2 (Rfix e) + StateDecodeLog ⟹ kstepAll e` rung, via `effectDecodeBridge_of_closedLogExtract`
    over the realizable `logHashInjective` `mkLog`) into the per-effect refinement. Since
    `kstepAll = dispatchArm` DEFINITIONALLY, this IS the `∀ e, descriptorRefines S_live hash (Rfix e)
    (dispatchArm e)` family the whole-turn fold consumes.

  * `CircuitSoundness.lightclient_turn_unfoolable_forest` — folds that family along the threaded
    `TurnDecodeChain` (the kernel-half-of-the-seam DERIVED, the frame tooth) into the genuine executor run
    `execFullTurnA start acts = some fin`, endpoints committing to the published turn-level `(pre, post)`.

## The HETEROGENEOUS win (no transfer-only residual)

`RotatedKernelForestFacet.lightclient_turn_unfoolable_forest_facet` carries `hidx0 : ∀ d ∈ c.steps,
∃ e, d.descr = R e ∧ e = 0` — EVERY step is the transfer effect. This module RETIRES that: the per-step
identification is the generic `hidx : ∀ d ∈ c.steps, ∃ e, d.descr = Rfix e` (the step's descriptor is the
registry entry for SOME effect index — ANY of the 36, mixed freely). The per-step arm at each effect is the
genuine `ClosedLogExtract`/`<e>_closedLog` rung, so a turn `[transfer, cellSeal, revoke, mint, …]` is
covered with each step landing its own proven soundness rung. The single-step floors, per-STEP, over
heterogeneous effects.

## NON-VACUITY (a mixed-effect turn is genuinely covered)

  * `closedLogExtract_family_covers_mixed` — the per-step family `closedLogExtract_all_genuine rds`
    INHABITS the rung at the NON-transfer effects cellSeal (52), revoke (2), mint (3) simultaneously
    (a mixed cohort). The family is not transfer-restricted: it produces a genuine `ClosedLogExtract` at
    each, routing through `cellSeal_closedLog`/`revoke_closedLog`/`mint_closedLog`.

  * `lightclient_unfoolable_circuit_sound_turn_empty` — instantiates the whole-turn closed apex on the
    DEGENERATE empty chain (the trivially-constructible `TurnDecodeChain` with no steps), demonstrating the
    apex's hypotheses are jointly satisfiable (the family + floors compose, no `False`-laundering).

/-! ## §1 — the whole-turn carried family, CLOSED from the genuine per-step readouts.

The whole-turn fold `lightclient_turn_unfoolable_forest` consumes `∀ e, descriptorRefines S hash (Rfix e)
(dispatchArm e)`. We BUILD that family from the per-step `ClosedLogExtract` family — itself realized by the
genuine `ClosureReadouts` bundle (every cohort slot calling its proven `<e>_closedLog` rung) — plus the
realizable `logHashInjective` log floor `mkLog`. `kstepAll = dispatchArm` definitionally, so the family this
produces IS what the fold needs. -/

/-- **`hrefines_forest_closed` — the per-effect refinement family, CLOSED from the genuine readouts.** From
the genuine `ClosureReadouts` bundle `rds` (each cohort slot routing through its proven `<e>_closedLog`
rung) + the realizable `logHashInjective` enrichment `mkLog`, the whole-turn fold's carried family
`∀ e, descriptorRefines S_live hash (Rfix e) (dispatchArm e)`. The proven soundness rungs are LOAD-BEARING:
this term names `closedLogExtract_all_genuine`, which names every `<e>_closedLog`. -/

/-! ## §2 — `lightclient_unfoolable_circuit_sound_turn`: THE WHOLE-TURN CLOSED APEX.

The centerpiece. A verified TURN — a `TurnDecodeChain` over HETEROGENEOUS effects (each step's circuit
`Satisfied2`, decoded, seam-published; the per-step effect identified by the generic `hidx`, ANY effect) +
the turn-level endpoint pinning (`TurnEndpoints`) + the realizable floors {`StarkSound`, `Poseidon2SpongeCR`
+ the `S_live` CR fields, `logHashInjective` inside `mkLog`, the per-step `ClosureReadouts` prover-witness
family} ⟹ a genuine executor run `execFullTurnA start acts = some fin` whose ENDPOINTS commit to the
published turn-level `(pre, post)`. NO transfer-only `hidx0`. The light client RAN NOTHING. -/

realizable crypto floors + the genuine per-step `ClosureReadouts` prover-witness bundle (routing through
every proven `<e>_closedLog` rung) ⟹ there EXISTS a genuine executor run `execFullTurnA s acts = some s'`
whose endpoints commit to the published turn-level `(pre, post)`. The carried floor set is EXACTLY the
single-step floors of `lightclient_unfoolable_circuit_sound`, now per-STEP: NO transfer-only residual. -/

/-! ## §3 — NON-VACUITY: a MIXED-effect turn is genuinely covered.

The per-step family `closedLogExtract_all_genuine rds` is NOT transfer-restricted. We exhibit it INHABITED
at three NON-transfer effects simultaneously (cellSeal 52, revoke 2, mint 3) — a mixed cohort — each slot
routing through its proven `<e>_closedLog` rung. This is the "mixed-effect turn is genuinely covered" tooth:
a turn `[…, cellSeal, …, revoke, …, mint, …]` has its per-step rung at EACH, not only at transfer. -/

simultaneously — each from the same `ClosureReadouts` bundle, each routing through its proven `<e>_closedLog`
rung. The whole-turn family genuinely covers heterogeneous effects, not transfer alone. -/
