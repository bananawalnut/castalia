# Dregg2.Circuit.SortedTreeNonMembership — THE IN-CIRCUIT sorted-Merkle NON-MEMBERSHIP open
  (the PHASE-D keystone the whole circuit-soundness campaign's convergent residual needs).

## Why this file exists (the freshness / non-amplification gadget)

`DeployedCapOpen.lean` builds the in-circuit MEMBERSHIP open: a `Satisfied` row over the IR-v2
Poseidon2 chip witnesses `MembersAt S cap_root leaf` (the depth-16 binary-Merkle recompose up a
sibling path). That is the "a leaf IS in the tree" half. This file builds the COMPLEMENTARY half: a
constraint set whose satisfaction proves a key `k` is NOT in the committed sorted set — the
**non-membership open**.

The standard sorted-Merkle non-membership argument (the SAME `Crypto.NonMembership.sorted_gap_excludes`
bracketing `AttestedQuery` rides for the query layer): a key `k` is absent iff you exhibit a COVERING
GAP — two ADJACENT present leaves `lo < k < hi` (the `inner` form), or `k` below the minimum present
key (`below`), or `k` above the maximum (`above`), or the tree is empty (`empty`). A valid gap
EXCLUDES everything strictly inside it; an absent key must fall inside some valid gap.

The "present" half is the DEPLOYED `MembersAt` opening (the `DeployedCapOpen` chip rows), so this
gadget composes DIRECTLY with the proven cap-open soundness — it adds ONLY the gap-bracketing on
top, it does NOT redo any chip binding.

## The reusable interface (what the capability family + spawn + attenuate-exact will consume)

  * `GapOpen S root spine` — the four covering-gap shapes (`inner`/`below`/`above`/`empty`), each
    carrying the DEPLOYED `MembersAt` openings of its bracketing neighbor leaves;
  * `GapOpen.excludes` — THE KEYSTONE: a valid gap covering `k` proves `k ∉ spine` (via
    `sorted_gap_excludes`); composed with `SpineCommits` (the root binds the spine) ⇒
    `nonMembership_sound : (open) ⟹ k ∉ keysOf root` — a key is absent from the COMMITTED tree;
  * `update_sound` (§5) — the in-row UPDATE: old root + non-membership of `k` + the insert recompute
    ⟹ new root = root of `insert k spine`. The gadget the capability family / spawn handoff /
    noteSpend-insert consumes next.

## The crypto residue (named precisely, HONEST)

Exactly ONE carrier beyond the deployed `CapHashScheme` already in play: `SpineCommits S root spine`
— "the sorted key spine `spine` is what `root` commits to" (the genuine sorted-list↔root binding,
the SAME residue `Crypto.NonMembership.NonMember` carries as a field, and `AttestedQuery` carries as
the `iroot`/CR floor). It is realizable (the deployed `compute_canonical_capability_root_felt`
discipline: the root IS the binary-Merkle fold of the sorted padded leaf list, whose leaf KEYS are
`spine`). It enters the soundness chain ONLY at the spine↔root step, never the bracketing — exactly
as `compress` CR enters `NonMembership` only via `extractable`, never the combinatorial heart.

The bracketing itself (`GapOpen.excludes`) is UNCONDITIONAL combinatorics. The two neighbor
`MembersAt` openings ride the proven `DeployedCapOpen` chip soundness — no new chip seam.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound} + the realizable Poseidon-CR carriers
`DeployedCapTree`/`AttestedQuery` already use (`Compress1CR` via the `CapHashScheme`; the spine↔root
binding `SpineCommits` is a HYPOTHESIS, never an axiom). NEW file; all imports read-only.

/-! ## §0 — the sort key + the committed key spine.

The deployed cap-tree sorts its leaves by `slot_hash` (`cap_root.rs:95`, the unique c-list slot
Poseidon image). So the committed sorted SET — the thing a key can be absent from — is the list of
leaf `slot_hash` keys in sorted order. The non-membership argument is over THIS key spine. -/

/-- **`keyOf l`** — the sort key of a deployed leaf: its `slot_hash` (`cap_root.rs::CapLeaf::slot_hash`,
the leaf-position sort key of the binary-Merkle fold). -/
def keyOf (l : CapLeaf) : ℤ := l.slot_hash

/-- **`SpineCommits S root spine`** — the (named, realizable) binding: the sorted key spine `spine`
is what `root` commits to. Concretely: `spine` is the sorted list of `slot_hash` keys of the leaf set
whose depth-16 binary-Merkle fold (`recomposeUp`/`MembersAt`) is `root`, AND every present leaf opens
at a key in `spine` while every key in `spine` is opened by a present leaf. This is the deployed
`compute_canonical_capability_root_felt` discipline (the root IS the fold of the sorted padded leaf
list). The SAME sorted-list↔root residue `Crypto.NonMembership.NonMember` carries as a field and
`AttestedQuery` pins via the `iroot` CR floor — a HYPOTHESIS, never an axiom.

We capture exactly the two facts the soundness chain needs:
  * `sorted` — the spine is strictly increasing (the tree is sorted-by-key);
  * `present_iff` — a `MembersAt` opening of a leaf exists at key `k` IFF `k ∈ spine` (the root binds
    the spine: you cannot open a leaf whose key is off-spine, and every on-spine key is openable). -/

/-! ## §1 — the covering-gap open (the four non-membership shapes, over DEPLOYED openings).

Mirrors `AttestedQuery.Gap` / `Crypto.NonMembership`'s bracketing, but each "present neighbor" is a
DEPLOYED `MembersAt` opening (a `DeployedCapOpen` chip row, soundness already proved). `inner loL hiL`
carries the two adjacent neighbor LEAVES (whose keys bracket `k`); the boundary forms carry the single
head/last neighbor leaf. -/

/-- **`GapOpen S root k`** — a non-membership covering-gap open for key `k` against the tree at `root`.
Each present-neighbor is a DEPLOYED `MembersAt` opening; the gap shape says where `k` sits relative to
the present neighbors. The witness a `Satisfied` non-membership row produces. -/

namespace GapOpen

variable {State : Type} {S : CapHashScheme State} {root k : ℤ}

/-- **`coversSpine g spine`** — the gap's claim is VALID against the committed key spine: its present
neighbors occupy the claimed head/last/adjacent positions, and `k` sits in the claimed interval. For
`empty` the spine is `[]`; for `below b` the head key is `keyOf b`; for `inner a b` the keys are
adjacent; for `above a` the last key is `keyOf a`. This is exactly `AttestedQuery.Gap.Valid` ∧
`covers`, here READ OFF the opened neighbor leaves' keys. -/

/-- **`GapOpen.excludesSpine` — THE COMBINATORIAL KEYSTONE.** A gap open valid against the SORTED
spine proves `k ∉ spine`: the `inner` case is LITERALLY `sorted_gap_excludes`; the boundary cases ride
the same strict order. UNCONDITIONAL — no crypto (the openings only pin the neighbor KEYS to the
spine, which `coversSpine` already records). -/

/-! ## §2 — THE KEYSTONE: `nonMembership_sound` (a valid gap open ⟹ `k ∉ keysOf root`).

Compose the combinatorial `excludesSpine` with the spine↔root binding `SpineCommits`: a gap open valid
against the committed spine proves `k` absent from the COMMITTED tree's key set. THE in-circuit
sorted-Merkle non-membership soundness — the analog of `attenuate`'s non-amplification. -/

/-- **`nonMembership_sound` — THE KEYSTONE.** Given the (realizable) spine↔root binding `SpineCommits`
and a gap open VALID against that spine (its present neighbors really occupy the claimed positions),
the queried key `k` is ABSENT from the committed tree (`k ∉ keysOf S root`). The bracketing is
`excludesSpine` (unconditional); `SpineCommits` is the only crypto residue, and it enters ONLY at the
spine↔root step. -/

  exact habsent ((keysOf_eq_spine S root spine hc k).mp hmem)

/-! ## §3 — the in-circuit non-membership ROW (riding two DEPLOYED `DeployedCapOpen.Satisfied` rows).

The non-membership AIR carries, for the `inner` shape, TWO cap-membership sub-rows (the `lo`/`hi`
neighbor openings, each a `DeployedCapOpen.Satisfied` over the chip), plus the gap gates: the two key
comparisons `keyOf lo < k < keyOf hi` and the adjacency side condition. The chip binding of each
sub-row is the PROVEN `DeployedCapOpen.capOpen_membership` — no new chip seam.

We give the `inner` row form (the load-bearing bracketing shape; the boundary forms are the same with
one sub-row). `kCol` is the queried-key column; `loRow`/`hiRow` are the two cap-open sub-row column
plans whose `cap_root` columns both equal `root`. -/

/-- **`NonMemberRowInner`** — the column plan + denotation for an in-circuit `inner` non-membership row:
two cap-open sub-rows (the bracketing neighbor openings) plus the gap comparison/adjacency conditions.
The non-membership AIR's `inner` shape. -/

/-- **`nonMemberRowInner_to_gapOpen`** — an `inner` non-membership row PRODUCES a valid `inner`
`GapOpen` against the committed spine: the two sub-rows' chip soundness (`capOpen_membership`) supply
the two `MembersAt` openings, and the gap gates supply the bracketing. The bridge from the in-circuit
row to the abstract gap open. -/

/-- **`nonMemberRowInner_sound` — THE IN-CIRCUIT NON-MEMBERSHIP KEYSTONE.** An `inner` non-membership
row, against a committed spine (the realizable `SpineCommits`), forces the queried key ABSENT from the
committed tree (`env.loc kCol ∉ keysOf S (env.loc loRow.capRoot)`). The two neighbor openings ride the

/-! ## §5 — the in-row UPDATE skeleton (`update_sound`): insert binds the new root.

The gadget the capability family / spawn handoff / noteSpend-insert consumes NEXT: given the OLD root
binds the sorted spine `spine`, a NON-MEMBERSHIP of `k` (so `k ∉ spine`), and the new root binds the
INSERTED spine `sortedInsert k spine`, the new root is exactly the root of `insert k spine`. We state
it as the binding fact (`SpineCommits S newRoot (sortedInsert k spine)`), which is what the downstream
consumers need; the per-row recompute (the sibling-path edit on the `MembersAt` fold) is the realizing
witness, the SAME chip rows the membership open already realizes.

The combinatorial heart — `sortedInsert` preserves sortedness and grows the set by exactly `k` — is
proved here UNCONDITIONALLY; the root-binding is the realizable `SpineCommits` carrier. -/

excluded by any gap covering it (the `coversSpine` would have to be a fake adjacency — FALSE);
