**This is Lean-authored AIR discharge, downstream of the security core.** The Rust-authored shielded
spend AIR (the now-retired `spend_circuit.rs`, width-20 `shielded_spend_descriptor()`,
C1–C7b as hand-written `ConstraintExpr` data) is house-law-#1 DEBT. Its Lean re-authoring is the two
emitted `EffectVmDescriptor2` objects Rust only *decodes/witnesses*
(`Emit.ShieldedSpendDescriptor.shieldedSpendDesc`, `Emit.ShieldedValueLinkDescriptor.shieldedValueLinkDesc`),
and the security core (`ShieldedSpendPortDischarge`, seams #15/#16) discharged `AccumulatorSound`/
`linkHolds` against those objects. This module ports the REMAINING soundness pieces the discharge
module named as residual — discharging what is dischargeable and keeping ONLY genuine crypto floors as
NAMED hypotheses (never axioms).

## §A — nullifier double-spend (the in-AIR half + the accumulator composition)

The deployed C4 binds `nullifier = hash_fact(current, key[0..4])` on the leaf row; the Lean C4′
(`lkNullifier`) binds `nullifier = hash_fact(leaf_commit, key[0..4])` with `current ≡ leaf_commit`
(C6b). This section proves the published nullifier is the nullifier of the ACTUAL spent leaf — a
GENUINELY COMMITTED note, not a free value:

  * **`emitted_nullifier_is_committed_note_nullifier`** — on a satisfying trace (sound chip table) the
    published nullifier PI ≡ the row-0 nullifier cell, which is `hash_fact(leaf_commit, key[0..4])`
    with `leaf_commit` a genuine `IsCommittedNote` (the C6 value-theft tooth) and `current ≡ leaf_commit`.
    So a replayed/forged nullifier is bound to a committed note; it cannot float free.
  * **`emitted_nullifier_determined`** — replay determinism: two satisfying spends of the SAME note
    (equal `leaf_commit`) with the SAME key publish the EXACT same nullifier cell. Spending a note
    twice yields a colliding nullifier — the detection precondition.
  * **`emitted_nullifier_double_spend_refused`** — THE COMPOSITION with the just-landed nullifier
    accumulator (`Exec.NullifierAccumulator`, over the 8-felt-keyed sorted-tree gate): once a first
    spend has committed its nullifier into the accumulator root, a second satisfying spend of the SAME
    note publishes a nullifier that admits NO valid `NfAccWitness` (`present_no_witness`). The in-AIR
    determinism (same note ⇒ same nullifier) meets the set-side non-membership (a committed nullifier
    has no fresh witness) — the double-spend is unrepresentable. We COMPOSE the landed sorted-tree
    accumulator; we do not re-prove non-membership.

## §B — the `NoteAccumulatorCR` fold-walk (per-row chain ↦ `foldPath`, floor reduced)

The discharge module named `NoteAccumulatorCR` (the ∀-leaf `AccumulatorSound` at the faithful
realization) as the residual floor and deferred "the multi-row Merkle fold-walk that recomposes the
per-row AIR chain into `foldPath` + Poseidon2 CR". This section does that recomposition and factors
the floor:

  * **`emitted_fold_step_all_rows`** — every row's `parent` IS `Hair hash current level` (generalizes
    the discharge's `emitted_fold_step_row0` off row 0; exact ℤ, from the C3 `lkParent` chip lookup).
  * **`emitted_chain_continuity`** — the C5 `chainWindow` forces `current[i+1] ≡ parent[i] [ZMOD p]`
    on every transition.
  * **`emitted_membership_chain`** — THE RECOMPOSITION: the emitted per-row chain IS an abstract
    Merkle fold — leaf `current[0]` `OpensAs` row 0's own opening cells, each step `current[i+1] ≡
    Hair hash current[i] level[i] [ZMOD p]`, and the final fold `Hair hash current[last] level[last] ≡
    the committed-accumulator PI`. The per-row AIR chain (C3 chip + C5 window) genuinely composes into
    the `foldPath` reaching the committed root (field-faithful mod-p at the junctions — a BabyBear
    Merkle proof IS a chain of mod-p equalities).
  * **`accumulatorSound_of_hashFloor`** — THE FLOOR REDUCTION: accumulator soundness at ANY note
    predicate follows from the SINGLE Poseidon2 second-preimage floor `FoldReachIsMember` (only a
    member folds to the committed root — the standard Merkle-root binding, the SAME shape as the
    deployed `SpineCommits8`/`Compress8CR` floor) PLUS the honest construction fact that members
    satisfy that predicate. The ∀-leaf assumption is no longer unbounded — it is factored into a
    bounded hash-CR floor over the accumulator's own committed set + a non-crypto construction fact.
    `noteAccumulatorCR_of_hashFloor` is its instance at `IsCommittedNote`.

## ⚑ ∃-IMAGE SWEEP CORRECTIONS (2026-07-24) — read `Dregg2.Verify.ExistsImageVacuity` first.

`IsCommittedNote` is an ∃-IMAGE: with four free field inputs onto ~2^31, the C6 site is expected to be
mod-p surjective, and then the predicate holds of EVERY felt — so a conclusion stated at it excludes
nothing. Two of this module's conclusions were stated there, and both are repaired at the resolution
the AIR actually supports:

  * `emitted_membership_chain` (i) and `emitted_nullifier_is_committed_note_nullifier` (1) now conclude
    at the CELL-PINNED `ShieldedSpendPortDischarge.OpensAs` — the opening is row 0's own cells, the
    ones C4 and C7a consume — which is strictly stronger and not vacuated by surjectivity.
  * `noteAccumulatorCR_of_hashFloor` is generalized to `accumulatorSound_of_hashFloor`, parametric in
    the note predicate, so the AUTHORIZATION-carrying instance (`ShieldedOnRampPin.IsLedgerNote`) is
    reachable through the same reduction.

⚠ **NOT strengthened to `IsLedgerNote` here, and why.** No trace-level theorem in this module can
conclude that the spent note was ledger-AUTHORIZED: a satisfying `shieldedSpendDesc` trace mentions no
ledger gate, no `Shield` entry, no committed set — the AIR relates cells to cells. Authorization is a
property of what the ACCUMULATOR contains, supplied by `ShieldedOnRampPin.shieldAppend_is_ledger_note`
(a construction fact of the Shield-A append) and carried into a spend by `accumulatorSound_of_hashFloor`
at the ledger predicate. Claiming it here would be manufacturing strength the emitted object lacks.

## §C — the mod-p → ℤ conservation range-lift

The value-link `conservation_holds` gives `Σ value ≡ Σ out_val [ZMOD p]`. Under the no-wraparound
bound (each prefix sum lands in `[0, p)`, which the `VALUE_BITS` range gadget establishes), that
congruence lifts to ℤ EQUALITY (`emitted_conservation_int`, via `modp_eq_of_bounds` — the honest
"no field wraparound disguises an over-mint" argument). The bound itself is supplied as a NAMED
hypothesis here; the in-AIR range GADGET (bit-decomposition columns proving each value `< 2^VALUE_BITS`,
`nleg_air.rs:397-408` / `Dregg2.Bignum.legs_noWrap_conservation`) is the named next lane.

## §D — #17 (the PQ / wide-commitment) verdict (assessed, not forced)

#17 is BOTH a structural port piece AND a deploy cutover — they are separable:

  * **STRUCTURAL (Lean-authorable AIR, tractable next lane).** The deployed `value_binding` is a
    1-felt (~31-bit) tag. Widening it to an 8-lane wide Poseidon output and tying conservation to the
    WIDE binding over faithful multi-limb value inputs is a Lean descriptor change: the wide chip lever
    already exists (`DescriptorIR2.chipLookupTupleN` / `ChipTableSoundN` / `chip_lookup_sound_N` forces
    every one of the W squeezed lanes). The value-link block (§B of `ShieldedValueLinkDescriptor`)
    would swap `lkValueBinding`'s 1-felt `cVB` for a `chipLookupTupleN` 8-lane digest + a multi-limb
    value encoding, and re-derive `value_link_bound` over the wide digest. Sizable (new wide golden +
    multi-limb conservation), so it is NAMED as the precise next lane, not smuggled in here.
  * **DEPLOY (Rust + VK regen, NOT Lean).** Retiring the off-AIR Ristretto three-generator Pedersen
    conservation (`commit_hidden_asset`, DLog, Shor-broken — `spend_circuit.rs:46-54`) and routing
    `apply_shielded_transfer` through the ring-clearing apex (`shielded_ring_clearing_nleg_air`) as a
    1-leg ring is the approved Option-A deploy (`docs/DECISION-shielded-redesign-2026-07-20.md`). This
    is the PQ cutover — it connects to the PQ campaign's adversary-indexed floor (the replacement is
    Poseidon-based conservation; the Ristretto DLog is the Shor-broken thing retired) — and is Rust +
    descriptor-JSON golden regen + VK regen, not a Lean theorem.

So the #17 verdict: structural-port half (wide value_binding + multi-limb conservation) is
Lean-authorable and tractable as a dedicated lane; the Ristretto-retire half is the deploy. Neither is
forced into this residual lane.

## Named residual for the rest of the port (honest)

Still open after this lane: the §D structural wide-value-binding lane; the §D Ristretto-retire deploy;
the §C in-AIR `VALUE_BITS` range GADGET (the bit-decomposition columns); the §B `FoldReachIsMember`
Poseidon2 second-preimage floor (a legitimate NAMED hash floor, the deployed `Compress8CR` shape) and
its realizable committed-accumulator construction; the field-reduction identification between the
emitted mod-p membership chain and the exact-`foldPath` floor (they coincide on the deployed
canonical-BabyBear-rep trace); and the Rust producer/emit wiring (`Effect::Custom` carrier in
`apply_shielded_transfer`, descriptor-JSON golden regen into `circuit/descriptors/` + `PROVENANCE.json`,
the apex fold supplying the committed-root PI) + the VK regen — the deploy step.

## Axiom hygiene

Bridge/composition theorems over the emitted objects + the landed accumulator; no new descriptor, no
deployed-code touch. Crypto floors enter as NAMED hypotheses (`FoldReachIsMember`, the accumulator's
`SpineCommits8` carried inside `NfAccWitness`, the §C range bound), never as axioms. `#assert_axioms`

/-- **⚑ THE #A DISCHARGE (`emitted_nullifier_is_committed_note_nullifier`).** On a satisfying
`shieldedSpendDesc` trace (under the chip AIR's own soundness) the published nullifier is bound to the
ACTUAL spent leaf, which is the C6 commitment of row 0's OWN opening cells — not a free value: the
row-0 `leaf_commit` `OpensAs` `(cVAL, cASSET, cOWNER, cRAND)` (C6a); the nullifier cell is
`hash_fact(leaf_commit, key[0..4])` (C4′); the membership `current ≡ leaf_commit` (C6b); and the
published nullifier PI ≡ that cell. A replayed or forged nullifier is therefore the nullifier OF the
note whose opening the spender exhibited in-trace.

/-- **⚑ THE SCOPE CORRECTION, CLOSED (`emitted_same_note_forces_same_key`).**

The correction below said: `hk0..hk3` ("SAME key") are HYPOTHESES an adversary controls, because
`cKEY0..cKEY3` occurred in `lkNullifier` and in NO other constraint, and `cOWNER` occurred only inside
`lkLeafCommit`, with nothing relating them. A prover could spend the same note under a fresh key,
publish a different nullifier, satisfy the AIR, and meet no accumulator member.

The missing constraint now exists: `ShieldedSpendDescriptor.lkOwnerDerive` (C8) forces
`owner = hash_fact(key[0..4])`. So the key is DERIVED FROM THE NOTE: the leaf commits the owner, the
owner commits the key. Two satisfying spends of the SAME note either carry the SAME key — making
`hk0..hk3` derived rather than assumed — or exhibit a Poseidon2 collision. There is no third option,
and the "fresh key per spend" double-spend is gone with it. -/

/-- **⚑ THE #A COMPOSITION (`emitted_nullifier_double_spend_refused`).**
⚠ **SCOPE CORRECTION 2026-07-30 — read the hypotheses before citing this.** The line below reads
"The full double-spend closure". It is NOT full, and the missing half is adversary-controlled:
`hk0..hk3` ("SAME key") are HYPOTHESES, and `cKEY0..cKEY3` occur in `lkNullifier` and in NO other
constraint of `shieldedSpendDesc` — nothing relates them to `cOWNER`, which likewise occurs only
inside `lkLeafCommit`. A prover spending the same note under a different key therefore publishes a
DIFFERENT nullifier, satisfies the AIR, and meets no accumulator member. What this theorem closes is
REPLAY WITH THE SAME KEY. Closing double-spend needs an in-AIR key↔owner derivation
(`owner = hash(key…)`, the Zcash `ivk`-shape binding) that no shielded descriptor in this tree emits.
The full double-spend closure:
the in-AIR nullifier binding (replay determinism) COMPOSED with the landed sorted-tree nullifier
accumulator (`Exec.NullifierAccumulator`, 8-felt-keyed). Once a first satisfying spend of a note has
committed its nullifier into the accumulator root `root`, a SECOND satisfying spend of the SAME note
(equal `leaf_commit`, equal key) publishes a nullifier that admits NO valid `NfAccWitness` — the
non-membership proof the replay would need does not exist (`present_no_witness`). We compose the landed
accumulator's `present_no_witness`; we do not re-prove non-membership. -/

/-- **⚑ THE #B RECOMPOSITION (`emitted_membership_chain`).** The emitted per-row Merkle chain (C3 chip
+ C5 window) IS an abstract `foldPath` reaching the committed-accumulator root: (i) the leaf
`current[0]` is the C6 commitment of row 0's OWN opening cells; (ii) each step `current[i+1] ≡ Hair
hash current[i] level[i] [ZMOD p]` — the fold advances by one `Hair` per level; (iii) the final fold
`Hair hash current[last] level[last] ≡ pi[committed_root] [ZMOD p]`. The deferred multi-row fold-walk
the discharge module named is now recomposed — field-faithful mod-p at the junctions (a BabyBear Merkle
proof IS a chain of mod-p equalities).

⚑ **STRENGTHENED 2026-07-24 (∃-image sweep).** Conjunct (i) was the ∃-image `IsCommittedNote hash
current[0]`, which under `ShieldedOnRampPin.C6Surjective` holds of every felt and so excluded nothing;
it is now the cell-pinned `OpensAs`, from which the ∃-image follows by `isCommittedNote_of_opensAs`.
⚠ It is NOT strengthened to `ShieldedOnRampPin.IsLedgerNote`, because the chain establishes REACH — the
leaf folds to the committed root — and reach only carries authorization when the ACCUMULATOR is sound
at an authorization-carrying note predicate. That is exactly what `accumulatorSound_of_hashFloor` below
supplies and what `ShieldedOnRampPin.shieldA_pin_spends_authorized` instantiates; no rearrangement of
this trace-level statement can produce it. -/

/-- **⚑ THE #B FLOOR REDUCTION (`accumulatorSound_of_hashFloor`, GENERALIZED 2026-07-24).** The
discharge module's ∀-leaf floor (`AccumulatorSound` at the faithful `Hair` realization) FOLLOWS FROM
the single Poseidon2-CR floor `FoldReachIsMember` (bounded, over the accumulator's own committed set)
PLUS the honest construction fact that every member satisfies the note predicate (the accumulator only
inserts leaves it built — no crypto). The ∀-leaf assumption is thereby factored into a legitimate
hash-CR floor + a construction fact; it is no longer an unbounded per-leaf assumption.

The note predicate is a PARAMETER, because nothing in the argument ever wanted the ∃-image: the
conclusion is exactly as strong as the construction fact supplied. Instantiate `note :=
ShieldedOnRampPin.IsLedgerNote hash auth` — whose construction fact is
`ShieldedOnRampPin.shieldAppend_is_ledger_note`, true by construction of the Shield-A append — and the
accumulator is sound at the AUTHORIZATION-carrying predicate, which is what
`ShieldedOnRampPin.shieldA_pin_spends_authorized` then spends against. Instantiate it at
`IsCommittedNote` and you get `noteAccumulatorCR_of_hashFloor`, which is vacuous under
`ShieldedOnRampPin.C6Surjective` (it holds at every root, including a prover-written one). -/

(`ShieldedOnRampPin.noteAccumulatorCR_vacuous_of_c6Surjective:363`); this instance therefore prices
nothing on its own. The instance that prices something is the same theorem at
