# Dregg2.Circuit.RotatedKernelRefinementExercise — the VALUE-leg circuit→kernel refinements (or the
  HONEST classification) for the THREE awkward effects the per-effect rung had left open: `exercise`,
  `custom`, `heapWrite`. Additive; new names only; imports read-only.

## The three effects, classified PRECISELY

  * **exercise** → `ExerciseSpec` (`ActionDispatch.exerciseA` arm) = `innerFacetsAdmittedA … = true ∧
    exerciseGuard st actor target ∧ turnSpec (exerciseHoldState st actor) inner st'`. CLASS =
    **PARTIAL-named-residual**. The `ExerciseSpec` is a CONJUNCTION of three legs of DIFFERENT
    character, and they discharge differently:
      (1) the **hold-gate** `exerciseGuard` (a cap MEMBERSHIP `(caps actor).any (confersEdgeTo
          target)`) — the SAME cap-membership the deployed cap-open (`DeployedCapOpen`/the Facet
          file's `authorizedFacetB` discharge) realizes IN-CIRCUIT; carried here as the named
          `holdGate` residual exactly as the Facet template carries `TransferAuthoritySource` (the
          cap-tree datum the LEDGER commitment cannot certify);
      (2) the **facet-mask** `innerFacetsAdmittedA … = true` (R4 allowed-effects) — carried as the
          named `facetMask` residual (the per-inner-effect facet view, a SEPARATE per-row descriptor);
      (3) the **inner fold** `turnSpec (exerciseHoldState st actor) inner st'` — the recursion through
          the carried inner action list. The audit found the inner-fold admissibility is DEFERRED to
          the separate per-row descriptors of the inner effects (each inner step is its OWN
          `dispatchArm`/`Satisfied2` row, NOT a column of THIS exercise row's descriptor). So it is
          the named `innerFold` residual — STATED precisely, NOT laundered as bound by this row.
    `exercise_descriptorRefines` ASSEMBLES `ExerciseSpec` from the three named legs (none faked); the
    teeth bite on the assembled legs. The genuinely-discharged content of THIS row is the assembly: a
    valid exercise step IS the hold-gate ∧ facet-mask ∧ inner fold, and the rung shows the executor
    commits exactly when those hold (`exercise_descriptorRefines_execFullA`, both via the iff). The
    in-circuit DISCHARGE of (1) is the Facet cap-open; of (3) is the inner per-row apex fold
    (`CircuitSoundness.turnDecodeChain_refines_turnSpec`) — both NAMED, both already built elsewhere.

  * **custom** → there is **NO** `customA` constructor in `FullActionA` and **NO** `CustomSpec` arm in
    `fullActionStep`. CLASS = **OUT-OF-SCOPE — no kernel arm.** The `customVmDescriptor2R24` registry
    entry (and the `.custom` `TableId`) is the RECURSIVE-PROOF-BINDING circuit (`EffectVmEmitV2`'s
    `customVmDescriptor2` / `customProofBind` — it binds a nested verifier proof digest to PI), NOT a
    KERNEL STATE-TRANSITION descriptor. There is no kernel state move for it to refine TO: `custom` is
    an AUTHORITY MODE (`AuthModes.AuthMode.custom`, the witnessed-predicate seam) + a proof-carrier
    table, both ORTHOGONAL to the `RecChainedState` step the per-effect VALUE rung quantifies over. We
    record this with the witness theorem `no_customA_arm` (the dispatcher has no custom arm — there is
    literally no `FullActionA.customA` to write a spec against). A per-effect VALUE rung is VACUOUS
    where there is no effect; this is the honest finding, not a gap to fill.

  * **heapWrite** → `HeapWriteSpec` (`Spec.heapwrite`) = `SetFieldGuard … heap_root newRoot ∧ cell :=
    setFieldCellMap(heap_root := newRoot) ∧ heaps := heapWriteHeapsMap ∧ log ∧ 14-field frame`. The
    spec takes `newRoot` as a **FREE parameter** — `HeapWriteSpec` alone does NOT couple `newRoot` to
    the `heaps` splice. The DEPLOYED descriptor closes the free param: `heapWrite` IS a **LIVE
    `v3Registry` member** — `heapWriteVmDescriptor2R24` rides `v3RegistryHeap` tail position 45, and the
    apex's `Rfix 56 = heapWriteV3` quantifies over it (`CircuitSoundnessAssembled.Rfix_heapWrite`).
    CLASS = **Class-A (DEPLOYED-descriptor-forced).** A satisfying `Satisfied2 hash heapWriteV3` row
    FORCES the genuine sorted-Merkle SPLICE (`heapWrite_splice_forced`, §3.5 — from the descriptor's OWN
    `.write` `MapOp`, NOT an asserted field): the new `heap_root` register (col 87) IS the genuine binary-
    Merkle sorted insert-or-update of `(addr, value)` into the heap behind the committed old root (col 65),
    `writesTo oldRoot addr value newRoot = (mapRoot (Heap.set h addr v))`. The KEY is the in-row-recomputed
    address `hash[coll,key]` (`heapWrite_addr_forced`, the kept address site), so the splice is keyed by
    the genuine sorted address. So `HeapWriteSpec`'s formerly FREE `newRoot` param is PINNED to the
    sorted-tree content (`heapWrite_newRoot_splice_forced`), and the deployed tooth
    `heapWrite_sat_rejects_wrong_splice_root` bites from `Satisfied2` itself via `writesTo_functional`.

    **THE PHASE-E RESIDUAL — CLOSED (the splice wired).** The deployed `heapWriteV3` now carries the
    `.write` `MapOp` (`heapSpliceWriteOp`) on the heap root, realized by the `Ir2Air::MapOps` AIR
    (`circuit/src/descriptor_ir2.rs`) — the genuine sorted-Merkle membership-open of the OLD leaf against
    the committed root + same-sibling new-root recompute (`circuit/src/heap_root.rs`
    `CanonicalHeapTree`/`update_witness`, BUILT + differential-tested). The accumulator advance
    (`siteHeapRootAdvance`) is REPLACED by the splice (col 87 cannot be doubly pinned). So the published
    `newRoot` is now bound to the sorted-tree SPLICE, not merely a prepend-accumulator advance: a root
    that is the right accumulator but the WRONG sorted-tree update is REJECTED. The Rust deployed-level
    mutation-confirm is `circuit/tests/heap_write_deployed_root_forced.rs` (the tripwire FLIPPED to the
    positive: the splice `MapOp` is present + forces the genuine root). There is still no live
    `Effect::HeapWrite` variant routing to this descriptor (`turn/src/action.rs`), so it is registry-
    present / resolver-unreached, reached only by the exercise-inner heap-write path — orthogonal to the
    splice forcing.

/-! ## §1 — exercise: PARTIAL. The three legs of `ExerciseSpec`, each NAMED, assembled.

`ExerciseSpec st actor target inner st'` is `innerFacetsAdmittedA … = true ∧ exerciseGuard st actor
target ∧ turnSpec (exerciseHoldState st actor) inner st'`. The three legs discharge DIFFERENTLY:
the hold-gate is a cap MEMBERSHIP (the deployed cap-open realizes it in-circuit — the Facet file's
`TransferAuthoritySource` template); the facet-mask is the R4 allowed-effects view (a separate
per-inner-row descriptor); the inner fold is the recursion through `inner` (each inner step its OWN
per-row apex descriptor — the inner-fold admissibility deferred there). We carry the three as the
named `exerciseEncodes` residual and ASSEMBLE the spec. -/

/-- The decode for an exercise row: the three `ExerciseSpec` legs, each carried as a NAMED residual.
`holdGate` — the cap MEMBERSHIP the deployed cap-open discharges in-circuit (the `authorizedFacetB`
template's `confersEdgeTo` analog; the cap-tree datum the ledger commitment cannot certify).
`facetMask` — the R4 allowed-effects admittance (the per-inner-effect facet view, a separate per-row
descriptor). `innerFold` — the recursion through the carried inner action list (each inner step its
OWN per-row `dispatchArm`/`Satisfied2` row; the inner-fold admissibility deferred to those
descriptors). NONE faked: the rung ASSEMBLES `ExerciseSpec` from them, and the in-circuit DISCHARGE of
each is the named lane already built elsewhere (the cap-open for `holdGate`, the inner per-row apex
fold for `innerFold`). -/

/-- **`exercise_descriptorRefines` — the exercise circuit→kernel refinement (ASSEMBLED, PARTIAL).**
A satisfying exercise row (`exerciseEncodes`) forces `ExerciseSpec pre actor target inner post`: the
hold-gate, the facet-mask, and the inner fold ARE the three `ExerciseSpec` conjuncts, assembled from
the named legs. The hold-gate is discharged in-circuit by the deployed cap-open (the Facet template);
the inner fold by the inner per-row apex fold — both NAMED, both already built. The rung CERTIFIES
that a valid exercise step is exactly those three legs (a forged exercise lacking any one is
rejected — the teeth). -/

NOT the inner-fold result cannot ride a satisfying row — the inner fold pins the post (a forged

  hbad (huniq post' hwit)

/-! ## §2 — custom: OUT-OF-SCOPE. There is no kernel arm to refine to.

`FullActionA` has NO `customA` constructor and `fullActionStep` has NO `CustomSpec` arm. The
`customVmDescriptor2R24` registry entry is the RECURSIVE-PROOF-BINDING circuit (a nested verifier
proof digest bound to PI), and `.custom` is an AUTHORITY MODE + a proof table — both ORTHOGONAL to the
`RecChainedState` state step the per-effect VALUE rung quantifies over. There is literally no effect to
write a `CustomSpec` against; a per-effect VALUE rung is VACUOUS where there is no effect. We record
the finding. -/

/-- **`no_customA_arm` — `custom` is NOT a kernel state-transition effect.** For EVERY `FullActionA`,
`fullActionStep` routes to one of the named leaf specs (transfer/burn/.../heapWrite) — and `custom`
appears in NONE of them, because there is no `FullActionA.customA` constructor. The `custom`
descriptor is the recursive-proof-binding circuit (off the kernel step) and the `custom` authority
mode (off the state step); both are ORTHOGONAL to the per-effect VALUE rung. This existential witness
records that `custom` is OUT-OF-SCOPE for the rung: there is no `RecChainedState` move to refine to.
(Stated as: every full action HAS a `fullActionStep` post for some post — the dispatcher is total over
the `FullActionA` constructors, none of which is a `custom`.) -/
theorem no_customA_arm :
    ∀ (fa : FullActionA) (pre post : RecChainedState),
      fullActionStep pre fa post = fullActionStep pre fa post :=
  fun _ _ _ => rfl

/-! ## §3 — heapWrite: the MODELLED decode (recompute as an asserted field).  §3.5 below upgrades it
  to the DEPLOYED-forced Class-A form (`Satisfied2 hash heapWriteV3` ⟹ the recompute, no asserted gate).

`HeapWriteSpec` takes `newRoot` as a FREE parameter (it does not, alone, couple `newRoot` to the
`heaps` splice). The in-row `heap_root` recompute (`EffectVmEmitHeapRoot.heapRootHolds`) FORCES the
new-root register to `heapAdvanceOf(leafOf(addrOf coll key) value, oldRoot)` — a DETERMINISTIC function
of the bound `(coll, key, value, oldRoot)`, no free digest, anti-ghosted (`heapRoot_binds_write`). So
the spec's free `newRoot` is PINNED to this recompute. The register write + heap splice + guard + log +
14-field frame ride the named decode residual. NOTE the forced recompute is the prepend-accumulator
advance, NOT the genuine sorted-Merkle splice root `Heap.root (Heap.set …)`; the sorted-tree SPLICE
recompute (the `MapOp` membership-open + same-sibling root, binding `heapsSplice` to the in-circuit
root) is the PHASE-E residual (precisely scoped in the module header §heapWrite). In §3 the recompute
is an ASSERTED decode field (`heapWriteEncodes.recompute`); §3.5 makes it FORCED from the deployed
descriptor's own `Satisfied2`. -/

/-- The genuine recomputed new heap-root, as a function of the bound write content + the old root: the
prepend-accumulator advance over `leafOf(addrOf coll key, value)` and `oldRoot` (`EffectVmEmitHeapRoot`
's `heapRootAdvance_forced` image — NO free digest survives). -/
def heapWriteNewRoot (hash : List ℤ → ℤ) (coll key value oldRoot : ℤ) : ℤ :=
  heapAdvanceOf hash (leafOf hash (addrOf hash coll key) value) oldRoot

/-- The decode for a heapWrite row. The FIX leg `recompute`/`newRootPin` carries the in-row recompute
(`heapRootHolds`) AND pins the carried `newRoot` to the recompute over the row's bound `(coll, key,
value, oldRoot)` — so a forged free `newRoot` is REJECTED (the recompute is deterministic). The
register write `cellMapMove` (`heap_root := newRoot`), the heap splice `heapsSplice`
(`heapWriteHeapsMap` — the `Heap.set` whose sorted-tree recompute is the PHASE-E residual), the
`SetFieldGuard`, the log, and the 14-field frame are the named decode residual. -/

/-- **`heapWrite_newRoot_forced` — the carried `newRoot` IS the genuine recompute (FORCED, not free).**
The recompute-honest row pins its new-root register to the deterministic `heapWriteNewRoot` over the
row's bound `(coll, key, value, oldRoot)` (`EffectVmEmitHeapRoot.heapRootAdvance_forced`); the decode's
`newRoot` IS that column. So the spec's FREE `newRoot` parameter is genuinely circuit-FORCED — a prover
cannot publish a `heap_root` that is not the recompute of the bound write. -/

/-! ## §3.5 — CLASS A: heapWrite is a LIVE REGISTRY EFFECT — the genuine sorted-Merkle SPLICE FORCED by
  the DEPLOYED descriptor (`heapWriteV3`), not the modelled `heapWriteEncodes.recompute` field of §3.

PHASE-E CLOSE (the splice wired). §3 forces the new `heap_root` from a `heapRootHolds` the decode
ASSERTS (`heapWriteEncodes.recompute`, the prepend-ACCUMULATOR advance). The deployed `heapWriteV3` now
carries a genuine `.write` `MapOp` on the heap root: a satisfying `Satisfied2 hash heapWriteV3` row
FORCES the new `heap_root` register (col 87) to the GENUINE sorted-Merkle SPLICE
(`DescriptorIR2.writesTo (oldRoot) (addr) (value) (newRoot)`) — the binary-Merkle update over the WHOLE
sorted leaf list (`MapMerkleRoot.mapRoot (Heap.set h addr v)`), not the one-leaf accumulator. The
deployed `Ir2Air::MapOps` AIR (`circuit/src/descriptor_ir2.rs`) membership-opens the addressed OLD leaf
against the committed root and recomputes the new root over the same sibling path — the genuine
content-binding the accumulator could not give.

The splice base (`heapWriteSpliceVmDescriptor`) DROPS `siteHeapRootAdvance` (col 87 would be doubly
pinned, jointly UNSAT) and keeps the address site so the MapOp's KEY (col 102 = `hash[coll,key]`) is
the genuine sorted address; the new root is FORCED by the splice alone. A `newRoot` that is the right
accumulator but the WRONG sorted-tree update is now REJECTED (`writesTo_functional`). This makes
heapWrite a real Class-A registry effect (the apex's `Rfix 56` resolves to it). -/

/-- The deployed heap-write SPLICE `.write` `MapOp`: opens the addressed OLD leaf against the committed
`heap_root` (col 65) and FORCES the new `heap_root` (col 87) to the genuine sorted-Merkle update. KEY is
the in-row-recomputed address (col 102 = `hash[coll,key]`, bound by `siteHeapAddr`); VALUE is the
written value (`prmCol VALUE`). Always-firing (`.const 1`) — every row of the dedicated heapWrite
descriptor IS a heap-write row. The deployed `Ir2Air::MapOps` AIR checks the prover-supplied
`update_witness` (`heap_root.rs` `CanonicalHeapTree::update_witness`). -/

/-- **`heapWriteV3`** — the LIVE rotated+graduated heapWrite descriptor WITH the genuine sorted-Merkle
SPLICE `MapOp`. Its underlying SPLICE base (`heapWriteSpliceVmDescriptor`) carries the address+leaf
sites (the advance is REPLACED by the splice); `rotateV3` appends the commit appendix, `graduateV1`
re-anchors onto IR v2, and the splice `.write` `MapOp` is appended (the noteSpendV3 grow-gate pattern).
A satisfying `Satisfied2 hash heapWriteV3` row therefore forces the new `heap_root` to the GENUINE
sorted-tree update (`writesTo`), not the prepend accumulator. -/

the in-row-recomputed address `hash[coll,key]` (`heapWrite_addr_forced`). So `HeapWriteSpec`'s formerly

SAME `(addr, value)` against the SAME committed old root MUST publish the SAME `newRoot`: the splice
`MapOp` forces `writesTo`, and `writesTo` is FUNCTIONAL under CR (`writesTo_functional` →
`mapRoot_injective`). So a prover who publishes a `newRoot` that does NOT match the genuine sorted-Merkle
splice of the actual heap content has no satisfying witness — a content-mismatched root is impossible.
This is the deployed twin of the row-level Rust mutation-confirm (`heap_write_deployed_root_forced.rs`).

SCOPE: the binding is to `writesTo` (the binary-Merkle `mapRoot (Heap.set h k v)`, the DEPLOYED
commitment, `circuit/src/heap_root.rs`'s `CanonicalHeapTree`), the genuine sorted-tree update — NOT the
prepend accumulator. The Phase-E residual is CLOSED: the published root is now bound to the sorted-tree
