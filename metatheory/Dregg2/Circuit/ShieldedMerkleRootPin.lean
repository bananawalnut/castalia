# Dregg2.Circuit.ShieldedMerkleRootPin — the shielded membership root is WIRE-SUPPLIED, not pinned
  to the committed accumulator (WOUND #15, the shielded-pool THEFT vector).

**What this proves, and why it was missing.** The deployed shielded transfer
(`turn/src/executor/apply.rs :: apply_shielded_transfer`) reconstructs the membership tree from a
PROVER-SUPPLIED root and checks membership against **that** root:

  * `ShieldedTransfer::from_serialized_parts(payload.merkle_root, …)` (`apply.rs:1738`) —
    the root is a wire field of the transfer payload;
  * `verify_stark_with_wide_bindings(&transfer, …)` (`apply.rs:1753`) proves each input note is a
    member of the tree at `payload.merkle_root` — the shielded-spend uni-STARK
    (the now-retired `spend_circuit.rs`) folds `parent = hash_fact(current,[sib0,sib1,sib2,pos])`
    up the 4-ary path and pins the last row's `current` to the `merkle_root` PI
    (`transfer.rs:91` `public_inputs`, `pis[MERKLE_ROOT] = merkle_root`);
  * **nowhere** is `payload.merkle_root` compared to any COMMITTED accumulator root — the state
    commitment binds the executor's live `commitments_root : Faithful8`
    (`turn/src/state_commit.rs:117`, `CommitmentSet::root8()`), but the shielded spend never consults it.

So a malicious prover picks a root of THEIR choosing, builds a tree containing any leaf they like
(a note that was never created), and honestly proves membership in *that* tree. The membership STARK
is perfectly sound — it just proves membership in the ATTACKER's tree. Result: **spend a note that was
never committed → theft / inflation.** As the decision brief puts it
(`docs/DECISION-shielded-redesign-2026-07-20.md` #15) this is *"larger than any felt-width birthday
collision; the ~31-bit width is the entry point, not the wound."*

**Where the metatheory was blind.** `Dregg2.Circuit.ShieldedTransferStark.StarkResidual` states the
deployed STARK's obligation as `∃ …, member (H [value, asset, owner, randomness]) pi.merkleRoot ∧ …`
— membership against `pi.merkleRoot`, the WIRE root — and its §5 "full floor list" names StarkSound,
Pedersen/Bulletproofs, blake3-CR, the C6↔C7a one-opening tie, and the value-link (#16) as the open
residual. The `merkleRoot = committedRoot` PIN is **absent from that list**: the abstract
`member … pi.merkleRoot` silently assumes `pi.merkleRoot` is the right root. This module supplies
exactly the invariant that assumption papers over. (That residual carried a SECOND blindness of the
same family — its value witness was tied to nothing, `Verify.ExistsImageVacuity` §5 — repaired
2026-07-24 by the tie now quoted above; the pin remains this module's business.)

**What is proved here** (theorems over ALL inputs; the model is faithful to the fold, HASH-AGNOSTIC —
it uses no property of the per-level hash beyond determinism, so it holds for the real Poseidon2):

  * **THE FALSIFIER (`root_substitution_forges`, `deployed_admits_but_pin_rejects`).** The deployed
    accept predicate — membership against the SUPPLIED root, with no committed-root conjunct — admits
    a payload whose supplied root is `≠` the committed root; the accepted leaf need not be a committed
    note (`¬ IsCommitted`), so a forged / double-spend note passes.
  * **THE LAUNDER, exposed (`mutation_breaks_membership` vs `mutation_test_is_not_the_pin`).** The
    Rust `forged_membership_root_rejects` test (`apply.rs:5174`) MUTATES an accepted payload's root
    (`payload.merkle_root += 1`) WITHOUT re-proving and observes the STARK now fails. That is real — but
    it only rejects root-mutation-without-reproof, NOT an attacker who PROVES against a chosen root.
    The theft survives it; the mutation test is not the pin.
  * **THE FIX, sound (`pinned_membership_against_committed`, `pinned_accept_is_committed`,
    `pin_rejects_root_substitution`).** Adding the conjunct `payload.merkle_root = committedRoot`
    forces membership against the COMMITTED root, so (a) the accepted leaf IS in the committed tree,
    and (b) under the accumulator's own soundness the accepted leaf is a genuinely committed note —
    and the attacker-tree forgery is REJECTED, over all inputs.

**Byte-safe / posture.** This module does NOT touch deployed code. The Rust root-pin check and the
in-AIR fold that would close #15 are the *approved Option-A redesign*
(`docs/DECISION-shielded-redesign-2026-07-20.md` + `PLAN-shielded-apex-redesign-2026-07-20.md`,
route the transfer through `shielded_ring_clearing_nleg_air` as a 1-leg ring) — the gated deploy,
NOT this file. This is the machine-checked statement of the invariant that redesign must establish:
the falsifier that prices the open wound and the soundness the pin buys.

**Scope (honest).** This is the FIRST brick of the `spend_circuit → Lean` campaign — the merkle-root
theft falsifier and the pin's soundness, at the resolution of the membership-root trust boundary
(NOT the full AIR). The accumulator's own soundness (a membership witness against the committed root
certifies a real note) is taken as the abstract hypothesis `AccumulatorSound`, exactly as
`FinalityCertWidth` takes `SigValid` — its discharge is the full `spend_circuit` AIR port; folding
`verify_value_link` (#16) into the AIR and the PQ-commitment (#17) are the rest of the campaign.

/-! ## 1. Felt, the 4-ary Merkle level, and the membership fold.

Faithful to `spend_circuit.rs`: one row per level, `parent = hash_fact(current,[sib0,sib1,sib2,pos])`,
chained `next.current == local.parent`, the leaf IS the input note commitment (no preimage row), and
the last row's `current` is pinned to `merkle_root`. The per-level hash is ABSTRACT (`H`) — the
theorems use nothing but its determinism, so they hold for the real Poseidon2 `hash_fact`. -/

IS the root). The final value is what the circuit pins to `merkle_root`. -/
def foldPath (H : Felt → Level → Felt) (leaf : Felt) : List Level → Felt
  | []          => leaf
  | lvl :: rest => foldPath H (H leaf lvl) rest

/-! ## 2. The DEPLOYED accept predicate — membership against the SUPPLIED root, root UNPINNED.

Faithful to `apply_shielded_transfer` at HEAD: `committedRoot` is passed (it is the live
`commitments_root` the state commitment binds) but the predicate never consults it — the wound in a
signature. -/

/-- **`accepts_independent_of_committedRoot` (the wound in one line).** The deployed predicate gives
the SAME verdict for every committed root — it does not look at the committed accumulator at all. So

/-! ## 3. THE FALSIFIER — the deployed accept admits a substituted (attacker) root.

The attacker builds their OWN tree (any leaf, any siblings), computes its root by folding, and
supplies `(leaf, path, thatRoot)`. Membership holds by construction; the supplied root is `≠` the
committed root. Hash-agnostic: true for the real Poseidon2 whatever it is. -/

/-- **`root_substitution_forges` (THE FALSIFIER).** For every hash `H` there is a committed root, a
distinct attacker root, a leaf and a path such that the deployed predicate ACCEPTS the transfer while
the supplied (attacker) root differs from the committed one. The witness uses a genuine one-level path
(the attacker's own tree), not a degenerate empty tree. -/

ANY leaf the attacker never had created (`¬ IsCommitted forgedLeaf`) and any level, there is a
committed root and a payload that:
  * carries the forged (uncommitted) leaf,
  * is ACCEPTED by the deployed predicate (membership in the attacker's own tree),
  * whose supplied root DIFFERS from the committed root (so the pin would bite),
  * and is REJECTED by the pinned predicate.
That is the theft: a note that was never committed is spent, and only the missing pin would stop it. -/

/-! ## 4. THE LAUNDER, exposed — the `forged_membership_root_rejects` test is not the pin.

The Rust reject-test (`apply.rs:5174`) does `payload.merkle_root = payload.merkle_root.wrapping_add(1)`
on an already-built payload and observes the STARK fail. It rejects root-MUTATION-without-reproof. It
does not reject an attacker who PROVES against a chosen root. -/

/-- **`mutation_breaks_membership` (the test is REAL).** If `p` verified, then `mutateRoot p` does

/-- **`mutation_test_is_not_the_pin` (the LAUNDER, exposed).** The mutation test rejecting a bumped
root does NOT close the theft: the attacker never mutates a fixed payload — they PROVE membership
against their own chosen root, and the deployed predicate STILL accepts the forgery while the pinned
predicate rejects it. The mutation test and the pin are different teeth; only the pin bites the theft. -/

/-! ## 5. THE FIX, sound — pin the supplied root to the committed accumulator root.

The single missing conjunct closes it: membership against the COMMITTED root (`acceptsPinned`, §2). -/

/-- **`pinned_membership_against_committed` (the fix, PURE).** The pin forces membership against the
COMMITTED root: an accepted leaf IS in the committed tree, witnessed by its own path. No floor —
substitution of the pin into the membership equation. This is precisely the `member commitment
committedRoot` that `ShieldedTransferStark.StarkResidual` states against the UNPINNED `pi.merkleRoot`. -/

/-- The accumulator's INTENDED soundness — a leaf that verifies against the COMMITTED root is a
genuinely committed note. ABSTRACT here (its discharge is the full `spend_circuit` AIR port + the

`SigValid`. NAMING IS FAKING, so it is a hypothesis, never a `def`-used-as-proof. -/

/-- **`pinned_accept_is_committed` (the fix, soundness form).** Under the accumulator's own soundness,
the pinned predicate admits ONLY genuinely committed notes: an accepted leaf is committed. So the
attacker-tree forgery — whose leaf is `¬ IsCommitted` — cannot pass the pinned gate. The theft closes. -/

/-- **`pin_closes_the_falsifier` (the two halves meet).** The very forgery the deployed predicate
admits (`deployed_admits_but_pin_rejects`) is (a) rejected by the pinned predicate directly (root
mismatch), and (b) under the accumulator's own soundness could NEVER be pinned-accepted, because the
pin would force the leaf to be a committed note — which it is not. The missing conjunct is exactly
the wound; (b) is the deeper reason the pin closes the theft. -/

/-! ## 6. NON-VACUITY — the falsifier and the fix FIRE on a concrete tree (executable witnesses).

A false `#guard` is a build error. `Hdemo` is a concrete deterministic stand-in for `hash_fact` (its
only USED property, as in the theorems, is determinism); the guards check that the forged leaf really
folds up an attacker path to an attacker root, that root differs from a distinct committed root, and
that a two-level chain folds as claimed. -/

#guard decide (foldPath Hdemo forgedDemo [lvlDemo] = 407) = true
-- Membership against the SUPPLIED (attacker) root holds — the deployed predicate accepts.
#guard decide (foldPath Hdemo forgedDemo [lvlDemo] = Hdemo forgedDemo lvlDemo) = true
-- … but the supplied root DIFFERS from a distinct committed root (attackerRoot + 1): the pin bites,
--   and membership against THAT committed root fails.
#guard decide (foldPath Hdemo forgedDemo [lvlDemo] = Hdemo forgedDemo lvlDemo + 1) = false
-- A genuine two-level chain folds as claimed: Hdemo 407 lvlDemo = 407*4 + 10 + 1 = 1639.
#guard decide (foldPath Hdemo forgedDemo [lvlDemo, lvlDemo] = 1639) = true

/-! ## 6.5 ⚑ THE RUST NOW PINS AT THE EXECUTOR (2026-08-07) — and why `accepts` STILL STANDS.

**Read this before flipping anything in this file.**

`apply_shielded_transfer` no longer receives a root. `ShieldedTransferPayload.merkle_root` is
DELETED; the executor reads `note_shielded.root8()` from live state (GATE 0) and every input's
`dregg-shielded-spend-complete-fsi2::v1` proof is judged with it as the 8-lane `piCommitted`. The
deployed-path exhibit is the KAT `executor_theft_forged_tree_refuses_on_the_deployed_path`
(`turn-prover/tests/shielded_executor.rs`): ONE payload, TWO executors differing only in committed
state — accepted by an executor whose accumulator IS the attacker's tree (so the payload is well
formed in every respect), REFUSED by one holding the real accumulator.

So `accepts` — the root-ignoring predicate of §2 — is no longer HEAD-faithful for the SPEND SIDE.
`acceptsPinned` is. `pin_rejects_root_substitution` has become a statement about the deployed
verifier rather than a proposed one.

**AND YET `deployed_admits_but_pin_rejects` IS NOT FLIPPED, DELIBERATELY.** The obvious move — retire
`accepts`, restate the theorem over `acceptsPinned`, and compose `ShieldedOnRampPin.
shieldA_pin_closes_15` to conclude the spend is LEDGER-AUTHORIZED — would be an OVERCLAIM, because
that composition's premise is measurably false at HEAD:

  * `shieldA_pin_closes_15` needs `FoldReachIsMember … (IsLedgerNote hash auth)`, discharged via
    `shieldAppend_is_ledger_note` — *every* leaf in the accumulator is a note the boundary gate
    authorized.
  * `apply_shield` GATE 4 appends the Poseidon2 `piCM` and satisfies that. **`apply_shielded_transfer`
    GATE 4 does not**: it appends the output leg's Ristretto Pedersen `commitment_bytes`, chosen by
    the prover. `note_shielded` therefore holds BOTH shapes, and `ShieldedOnRampPin.
    deployed_append_unsound` / `l4_pin_over_deployed_append_relocates_15` are still true of the
    transfer-written half.

**What actually blocks the relocation, and at what resolution.** A spendable leaf's address is
`felt_to_bytes32(cCM)` — four significant bytes and twenty-eight ZERO — because the Lean-emitted
complete-spend relation pins `cADDR0`/`cADDR1` and constrains the higher limbs to zero, while the
accumulator's leaf address is the RAW 32 bytes (sixteen `u16` limbs, `2^256` on the nose). A
transfer-appended leaf must decompress as a valid Ristretto point for the conservation gate, so
landing one in that subspace needs a compressed encoding with 224 zero bits: ~`2^-224`.

That argument is an **ENCODING DISJOINTNESS**, and this model cannot see it — `Felt := ℤ`, `Note` has
no byte encoding, so `l4_pin_over_deployed_append_relocates_15`'s freely-chosen `deployedAppendLeaf
wire` is realizable IN THE MODEL and infeasible IN DEPLOYMENT. It is checked only by the Rust KAT
`transfer_output_append_is_prover_written_and_cannot_be_opened_by_any_spend`, which asserts the
appended bytes lie outside the openable subspace. **A Rust case-test is not a theorem**; this is
named as the resolution's resolution, not laundered as one.

**THE PRECISE FOLLOW-ON, so the next lane does not flip this blind.** Either
  (a) model the address encoding here (the 4-byte/28-zero subspace vs the raw-32-byte leaf key) and
      prove the two images disjoint, which makes the relocation unrealizable as a THEOREM; or
  (b) land the L0.5 output relation — a Lean-authored note-creation AIR with HIDDEN value (the input
      side's wide-carrier join, minus the membership fold) so a transfer's output commitment is a
      Poseidon2 note commitment BOUND to its output leg's Pedersen value, and GATE 4 appends THAT.
      Then `shieldAppend_is_ledger_note` holds for the whole accumulator and the composition above
      becomes sound.
Appending a prover-chosen note commitment WITHOUT (b)'s binding would be strictly worse than today:
it would be a mint from nothing. Do not take that shortcut to reach the flip.

§2's falsifier is retained as-is because it still PRICES what was fixed: it is the machine-checked
statement of the wound the 2026-08-07 flag day closed on the spend side. -/
