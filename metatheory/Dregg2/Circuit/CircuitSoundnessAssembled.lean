# Dregg2.Circuit.CircuitSoundnessAssembled — the COMPOSITION CAPSTONE.

`CircuitSoundness.lightclient_unfoolable` is the apex: from a verifying batch + the named floors it
concludes a genuine kernel transition committing to the published `(pi.pre, pi.post)`. But it carries
the per-effect refinement family `hrefines : ∀ e, descriptorRefines S hash (R e) (kstep e)` as an
OPAQUE hypothesis. This module makes that `∀` EXPLICIT, ENUMERATED, and NAMED.

## What is assembled

  1. **`Rfix : Registry`** — the live `v3Registry` lookup as a `Nat`-indexed `Registry` (the descriptor
     each per-effect rung is about). `Rfix e` is the rotated descriptor at the effect tag `e`
     (`ActionDispatch.actionTag`'s convention); out-of-range indices fall back to the transfer slot
     (the registry is total as a function — every effect index resolves to a real `EffectVmDescriptor2`,
     so `vkOfRegistry Rfix` is well-defined). The fix descriptors (the committed-root-limb variants) and
     the phase-D cap descriptors are the SAME `v3Registry` entries the rungs are stated against, so
     `Rfix` IS the per-effect descriptor each rung discharges.

  2. **`kstepAll : EffectIdx → RecChainedState → RecChainedState → Prop`** — the assembled dispatcher.
     We take `kstepAll := CircuitSoundness.dispatchArm`, the generic dispatcher arm
     (`∃ fa, actionTag fa = e ∧ fullActionStep pre fa post`) the whole-turn apex
     `lightclient_turn_unfoolable_forest` is already stated at. Its `e = 0` (transfer) arm is upgradable
     to the FAITHFUL `dispatchArmFacet` via `RotatedKernelRefinementFacet.dispatchArmFacet_to_dispatchArm`
     (the deployed two-axis authority gate), recorded here as the faithful-tier note.

  3. **`EffectDecodeBridge S hash R e`** — the per-effect decode bridge, NAMED. It is EXACTLY
     `descriptorRefines S hash (R e) (kstepAll e)` — the apex-shaped per-effect rung. The honest content:
     each landed per-effect rung (`transfer_descriptorRefines`, `delegate_descriptorRefines`, …)
     concludes its leaf `Spec` from a per-effect ENCODE decode (`rotatedEncodes` /
     `DelegateCapsTreeEncodes` / …), NOT from `StateDecode`. The commitment surface `StateDecode`
     commits the LEDGER ROOT only; the limb-level encode data (the guard fields, the cap-tree opening,
     the per-row column reads) is the genuine residue `StateDecode` cannot carry. So the bridge is NOT
     `StateDecode ⟹ <effect>Encode` (a category error: `StateDecode pc pre post` does not even mention
     the trace `t`, while `<effect>Encode` is a predicate ABOUT `t`'s columns) — the genuine bridge is
     `Satisfied2 (R e) … t ⟹ <effect>Encode`, the per-effect circuit-witness column-read extraction
     (the `WitnessDecodes`-class limb decode the honest prover's trace supplies, certified by
     `StarkSound`); `StateDecode` only supplies the kernel boundary the encode is matched against. NONE
     of the 36 effects bridges from `StateDecode` alone, so the bridge is carried for EVERY effect as the
     named per-effect residual `EffectDecodeBridge`.

     This capstone carries the family OPAQUE (`∀ e, EffectDecodeBridge` as a hypothesis); the closure
     stack REDUCES it. `ClosureAll.effectDecodeBridge_of_closedLogExtract` discharges each
     `EffectDecodeBridge e` from a `ClosedLogExtract e` (= `Satisfied2 (R e) + StateDecodeLog ⟹ kstepAll
     e`), and `ClosureFanoutGenuine.closedLogExtract_all_genuine` discharges `∀ e, ClosedLogExtract` for
     all 36 effects from a `ClosureReadouts` bundle of the per-effect `<e>TraceReadout`
     (`Satisfied2 ⟹ <e>Encodes`) floors, each slot CALLING its proven `<e>_closedLog` /
     `*_descriptorRefines_sat` rung. `ClosureFinal.lightclient_unfoolable_circuit_sound` then collapses
     the `∀ e` over-ask to ONE floor at the published `pi.effect`. So the post-reduction carried set is
     `StarkSound` + `Poseidon2SpongeCR`/`logHashInjective` (standard CR) + the per-effect
     `Satisfied2 ⟹ encode` readout (standard SNARK-witness class) — NOT a `StateDecode`-bridge residual,
     and NOT a new crypto carrier.

  4. **`hrefinesAll`** — `∀ e, descriptorRefines S hash (Rfix e) (kstepAll e)`, assembled from the
     per-effect bridge family `(∀ e, EffectDecodeBridge S hash Rfix e)`. Since `EffectDecodeBridge` IS
     the per-effect `descriptorRefines`, this is the explicit enumeration of the apex's carried `∀` — the
     OPAQUE hypothesis is now a NAMED, per-effect family with its content spelled out.

  5. **`lightclient_unfoolable_assembled`** — the apex instantiated at `Rfix`/`kstepAll`/`hrefinesAll`.
     Its carried floors are EXPLICIT: `StarkSound`, `Poseidon2SpongeCR`, the `CommitSurface` CR fields,
     `WitnessDecodes`, and the enumerated `EffectDecodeBridge` family. The whole-turn version
     `lightclient_turn_unfoolable_forest_assembled` lifts the same to a verified turn.

## The honest carried-floors ledger

  * `[StarkSound hash Rfix]` — the audited p3 batch-STARK extraction (REALIZABLE, named, not faked).
  * `Poseidon2SpongeCR hash` + the `CommitSurface` CR fields — the decode faithfulness floor (REALIZABLE).
  * `WitnessDecodes hash Rfix S pi` — the witness→kernel-state EXISTENCE rung (REALIZABLE, named).
  * **`∀ e, EffectDecodeBridge S hash Rfix e`** — THE ENUMERATED per-effect decode bridge family. This
    is the apex's old opaque `hrefines` made an explicit, per-effect residual set. Each `e`'s bridge is
    the genuine `Satisfied2 (R e) … t ⟹ <effect>Encode` circuit-witness column-read extraction the
    commitment surface cannot certify (NOT `StateDecode ⟹ <effect>Encode` — `StateDecode` has no `t`).
    The LOGICAL CORE of each rung (`<effect>Encode ⟹ <effect>Spec ⟹ dispatchArm e`) is fully landed in
    the `RotatedKernelRefinement*` family; the bridge is precisely the missing decode-extraction half —
    and it is REDUCED, for all 36 effects, to the named `<e>TraceReadout` (`WitnessDecodes`-class)
    floors in `ClosureFanoutGenuine`/`ClosureFinal` (see §3). This capstone is the OPAQUE-`∀` waypoint;
    the reduced apex is `ClosureFinal.lightclient_unfoolable_circuit_sound`.

This is the honest capstone: the apex stands mod ONE named, enumerated family (`EffectDecodeBridge`)
plus the standard crypto/extraction floors — NOT an opaque carried `∀`.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` on the capstone theorems ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}. The named carriers
(`StarkSound`, `Poseidon2SpongeCR`, the `CommitSurface` CR fields, `WitnessDecodes`, the
`EffectDecodeBridge` family) are HYPOTHESES, not axioms — they do not appear in the axiom set.

/-! ## §1 — `Rfix`: the live `v3Registry` as a total, `actionTag`-keyed `Registry`.

The apex's `Registry` is `EffectIdx → EffectVmDescriptor2` (a TOTAL function, so `vkOfRegistry` /
`StarkSound.extract` are well-defined at every published effect index). The deployed registry
`EffectVmEmitRotationV3.v3Registry` is a `List (String × EffectVmDescriptor2)` keyed by descriptor
NAME — and its LIST POSITION does NOT coincide with `ActionDispatch.actionTag` (position 1 is `burn`
while `burn`'s tag is `4`; position 2 is `mint` while `mint`'s tag is `3`; only transfer aligns at 0).
The per-effect `*_closedLog`/`ClosedLogExtract` rungs are stated at `actionTag` (`kstepAll <tag>`,
consuming `Satisfied2 (R <tag>)`), so a position-keyed `Rfix` would land each rung at the WRONG
descriptor for every effect except transfer. `Rfix` therefore re-keys by `actionTag`: `Rfix e` is the
genuine `v3Registry` descriptor for the effect whose `ActionDispatch.actionTag` is `e`.

`actionTagToPos` is the explicit `actionTag ↦ registry-position` table (the inverse of the registry's
declaration order). `Rfix e` looks up `v3Registry` at `actionTagToPos e`. Tags with no own rotated
descriptor (the `Scap`/`compressN`-parametric rungs — delegate, revoke, the lifecycle/birth/note family)
point at the `v3Registry` entry their effect family rides (introduce for delegate, the cap revoke for
revoke, …), so `vkOfRegistry Rfix` ranges over exactly the deployed descriptor set; `heapWrite` (tag 56)
NOW has its OWN LIVE Class-A descriptor `heapWriteV3` (the heap-root recompute), at `v3RegistryHeap` tail
position 45 — `Rfix 56 = heapWriteV3` (GAP-2 close). Off-range tags fall back to transfer, so `Rfix` is
total. The key correspondence — `Rfix 0 = transferV3` — is preserved by `rfl` (position `0`), so
`closedLogExtract_transfer` lands at its genuine descriptor. -/

is the LAST registry effect, its genuine Class-A descriptor `heapWriteV3` (the three heap-root recompute

preserved; `actionTagToPos 56` re-keys to 45 so `Rfix 56` resolves to `heapWriteV3` (no longer the

no own descriptor (heapWrite, off-range) fall back to the transfer descriptor, so `Rfix` is total. This
lands each per-effect rung (stated at `actionTag`) at its GENUINE descriptor — in particular
`Rfix 0 = transferV3` by `rfl`. -/
def Rfix : Registry := fun e =>
  match v3RegistryHeap[actionTagToPos e]? with
  | some (_, d) => d
  | none => transferDescr

/-- `Rfix` is total: every effect index resolves to a real descriptor (so `vkOfRegistry Rfix` and the
`StarkSound`/`WitnessDecodes` floors are well-defined at every published index). Holds by construction
(`match` is total). -/
theorem Rfix_total (e : EffectIdx) : ∃ d : EffectVmDescriptor2, Rfix e = d := ⟨Rfix e, rfl⟩

/-- **`Rfix_transfer` — the key correspondence: the transfer tag lands at the transfer descriptor.**
`actionTag (.balanceA …) = 0` and `actionTagToPos 0 = 0`, and `v3Registry`'s position-`0` entry is the
transfer descriptor `v3OfFrozen transferVmDescriptor = transferV3`. So `Rfix 0` IS the genuine transfer
descriptor — the rung at the transfer tag discharges its refinement about the right descriptor. -/
theorem Rfix_transfer : Rfix 0 = Dregg2.Circuit.RotatedKernelRefinement.transferV3 := rfl

/-- **`Rfix_heapWrite` — GAP-2: heapWrite (tag 56) ranges over its OWN LIVE descriptor.** `actionTagToPos
56 = 45` and `v3RegistryHeap`'s position-45 entry is the genuine Class-A `heapWriteV3` (the heap-root
recompute, `RotatedKernelRefinementExercise.heapWrite_descriptorRefines_sat`). So `Rfix 56` is no longer
the transfer fallback: `vkOfRegistry Rfix` / the apex's `StarkSound hash Rfix` now quantify over the
deployed heapWrite descriptor, and the heapWrite rung discharges its refinement about the RIGHT one.
What this forces is the ACCUMULATOR recompute of the `heap_root` register (anti-ghosted by the bound
write); the genuine sorted-Merkle `heaps`-SPLICE binding (`heapsSplice ↔ Heap.root(Heap.set …)` via a
`MapOp`) is the named Phase-E residual — see `RotatedKernelRefinementExercise` module header §heapWrite. -/

/-- **`Rfix_setProgram` — SetProgram (tag 13) ranges over its OWN LIVE descriptor.** `actionTagToPos
13 = 51` and `v3RegistryHeap`'s position-51 entry is the genuine Class-A `setProgramV3` (the program
record-pin, `RotatedKernelRefinementProgram.setProgram_descriptorRefines_sat`). So `Rfix 13` is no
longer the transfer fallback: the SetProgram rung discharges its refinement about the RIGHT descriptor,
and `vkOfRegistry Rfix` now quantifies over the deployed SetProgram descriptor. -/

    Rfix 13 = Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.EffectVmEmitRotationV3.setProgramV3 := rfl

/-- **`Rfix_capOpen` — F5: the apex's registry RANGES OVER the LIVE in-circuit authority descriptor.**
The attenuate tag (`12`) re-keys to `v3RegistryCapOpen` position `43` — the LIVE cap-open authority
member `attenuateCapOpenEffV3` (the genuine-submask + decoded-tier descriptor carrying the depth-16
in-circuit cap-membership open). So `vkOfRegistry Rfix` / the apex's `StarkSound hash Rfix` quantify
over the SAME descriptor the deployed prover routes AND the apex authority leg refines
(`transferCapOpenEffV3_authorizes`): the one in-circuit authority gadget is INSIDE the registry the
light-client apex commits, not beside it — and it is the LIVE one, not a pinned twin. -/
theorem Rfix_capOpen : Rfix 12 = Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.CapOpenEmit.attenuateCapOpenEffV3 := rfl

/-- **`Rfix_exercise_capOpen` — exercise (tag 16) RANGES OVER its LIVE cap-open authority descriptor.**
`actionTagToPos 16 = 53` and `v3RegistryHeap`'s position-53 entry is `exerciseCapOpenV3` (the frozen
exercise base + the EFF_EXERCISE depth-16 cap-membership crown). So `Rfix 16` is no longer the bare
authority-free `exerciseV3`: `vkOfRegistry Rfix` / the apex's `StarkSound hash Rfix` now quantify over the
crown-bearing descriptor the SDK route proves through AND the apex hold-gate rung forces
(`RotatedKernelRefinementExerciseAuth.exercise_descriptorRefines_capOpenSat`). The exercise hold-gate is
FORCED in-circuit — the LAST named cap-open residual CLOSED. -/

    Rfix 16 = Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.CapOpenEmit.exerciseCapOpenV3 := rfl

/-! ### The 6 FAN-OUT cap-effect tags route to their LIVE cap-open authority descriptors.

Each cap-authorized fan-out tag re-keys (via `actionTagToPos`) to its `…CapOpenV3` fan-out descriptor
(`v3RegistryCapOpen` positions 36..40), so `vkOfRegistry Rfix` / the apex's `StarkSound hash Rfix` quantify
over the SAME descriptor the deployed prover routes (`cap_open_route_for_run`) AND the apex authority leg
forces (`…CapOpenV3_authorizes` ⟹ `authorizedFacetEffB … (1 <<< n)`). Their authority is FORCED in-circuit
at the effect's OWN bit, no longer riding the toy gate. (`revokeCapability` [position 41] is the SEVENTH
fan-out tag — Lean tag `24` = the wire `sel::REVOKE_CAPABILITY` selector — re-keyed below; its authority is
forced at its OWN bit `1 <<< EFF_REVOKE_CAPABILITY = 1 <<< 3` and its genuine kernel transition is the shared
`RevokeSpec` removeEdge step it lowers to. NO longer unreachable.) The fan-out descriptor is `base +
appendix` (the appendix appends columns and reads NO base column — `effCapOpenV3_satisfiedEff`), so each
tag's VALUE/`ClosedLog` rung — carried `Satisfied2 hash (Rfix <tag>)`-parametrically in
`ClosureFanoutGenuine` — composes verbatim over the re-keyed descriptor (the base columns the readout
reads are unchanged; the trace merely carries the extra appendix columns). -/

/-- delegate (tag 1) routes to the WRITE-FORCING delegate fan-out cap-open (`delegateWriteCapOpenV3`,
position 46) — the cap-tree insert FORCED, guarantee A circuit-bound. -/
theorem Rfix_delegate_capOpen : Rfix 1 = Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.CapOpenEmit.delegateWriteCapOpenV3 := rfl
/-- revoke (tag 2) routes to the WRITE-FORCING revoke fan-out cap-open (`revokeDelegationWriteCapOpenV3`,
position 49 — the SAME write-bearing descriptor tag 14 rides). `.revoke holder t` lowers to the SAME shared
`RevokeSpec`/`removeEdgeCaps` kernel step as `.revokeDelegationA holder t`, so the cap-tree REMOVE is FORCED
on the moving genuine face — guarantee A circuit-bound, no longer the frozen `revokeCapOpenV3`. -/

fan-out cap-open (`revokeCapabilityCapOpenV3`, position 41) — DISTINCT from the revoke(Delegation)

ranges over the position-41 descriptor the deployed prover routes (`cap_open_route_for_run`) — the
previously-unreachable keystone is now in the apex's registry image. -/

no longer the frozen-`cap_root` `spawnVmDescriptor2R24`. So `vkOfRegistry Rfix` / the apex's `StarkSound

/-! ## §2 — `kstepAll`: the assembled dispatcher arm.

We take the assembled kernel step to be the generic dispatcher arm `CircuitSoundness.dispatchArm`
(`∃ fa, actionTag fa = e ∧ fullActionStep pre fa post`) — the relation the whole-turn apex
`lightclient_turn_unfoolable_forest` is already stated at, and into which every per-effect leaf `Spec`
lowers (`transfer_descriptorRefines_fullActionStep`, `delegate_execFullA`, …). The `e = 0` (transfer)
arm upgrades to the FAITHFUL `dispatchArmFacet` (deployed two-axis authority) via
`RotatedKernelRefinementFacet.dispatchArmFacet_to_dispatchArm`. -/

/-- **`kstepAll`** — the assembled kernel step: the generic dispatcher arm at each effect. Its `e = 0`
transfer arm is faithful-upgradable (`dispatchArmFacet`); every effect's leaf `Spec` lowers into it. -/

/-! ## §3 — `EffectDecodeBridge`: the per-effect decode bridge (NAMED, enumerated).

`EffectDecodeBridge S hash R e` is the per-effect refinement rung in APEX SHAPE: it is exactly
`descriptorRefines S hash (R e) (kstepAll e)`. This is the honest residual.

The logical CORE of every effect — `<effect>Encode ⟹ <effect>Spec ⟹ dispatchArm e` — is fully landed
in the `RotatedKernelRefinement*` family (`transfer_descriptorRefines` / `delegate_descriptorRefines` /
`attenuate_descriptorRefines_exact` / `revoke_descriptorRefines` / … through all 36 cohort members + the
8 `setField` slots). What is NOT landed is the bridge from the apex's `StateDecode S pc pre post` (the
LEDGER-ROOT commitment binding) to the per-effect ENCODE predicate each rung consumes (`rotatedEncodes`,
`DelegateCapsTreeEncodes`, `rotatedEncodesIncNonce`, …): the encode carries limb-level column reads, the
cap-tree opening, and the guard fields the commitment surface does NOT commit. Bridging
`StateDecode ⟹ <effect>Encode` is the genuine remaining content — the `WitnessDecodes`-class
decode-extraction, per effect.

We carry it as ONE named per-effect family. NO effect bridges cleanly from `StateDecode` alone (the
ledger root never determines the cap-tree leaf assignment, the per-row columns, or the guard), so all
36 effects (44 indices counting the 8 `setField` slots) are genuine `EffectDecodeBridge` residuals. -/

/-- **`EffectDecodeBridge S hash R e` — the per-effect decode bridge (NAMED).** Exactly the apex-shaped
per-effect refinement `descriptorRefines S hash (R e) (kstepAll e)`: any `Satisfied2` witness of the
descriptor `R e` whose published commitments `StateDecode`-decode to `pre`/`post` forces
`kstepAll e pre post`. The genuine content is the `StateDecode ⟹ <effect>Encode` extraction (the
limb-level decode the LEDGER-root commitment cannot certify); the rung's logical core
(`<effect>Encode ⟹ dispatchArm e`) is landed in `RotatedKernelRefinement*`. Carried, named, not faked. -/

/-! ## §4 — `hrefinesAll`: assemble the per-effect bridge family into the apex's `∀`.

Given the named per-effect bridge family `(∀ e, EffectDecodeBridge S hash Rfix e)`, the apex's carried
`hrefines : ∀ e, descriptorRefines S hash (Rfix e) (kstepAll e)` is IMMEDIATE — `EffectDecodeBridge` IS
that `descriptorRefines`. This is the enumeration of the previously-opaque `∀`: it is now a per-effect
NAMED family whose content (the `StateDecode ⟹ <effect>Encode` decode bridge) is spelled out. -/

/-- **`hrefinesAll` — the apex's per-effect family, ENUMERATED.** From the named per-effect decode-bridge
family, the registry-wide refinement `∀ e, descriptorRefines S hash (Rfix e) (kstepAll e)` the apex
carries. The previously-opaque `∀` is now an explicit per-effect residual set. -/

/-! ## §5 — `lightclient_unfoolable_assembled`: the apex at `Rfix`/`kstepAll`/`hrefinesAll`.

The capstone. From a verifying batch against `vkOfRegistry Rfix` + the named floors
(`StarkSound`, `Poseidon2SpongeCR`, the `CommitSurface` CR fields, `WitnessDecodes`) + the ENUMERATED
per-effect decode-bridge family (`∀ e, EffectDecodeBridge S hash Rfix e`), there EXIST decoded endpoints
and a genuine kernel transition `kstepAll pi.effect pre post` whose endpoints commit to the published

/-! ## §6 — the whole-turn capstone (forest shape), at `dispatchArm = kstepAll`.

`kstepAll = dispatchArm`, so the whole-turn apex `lightclient_turn_unfoolable_forest` instantiates at
`Rfix` directly. A verified turn (`TurnDecodeChain` — every step's circuit `Satisfied2`, decoded, seams
agreeing) whose per-step effect indices are identified (`hidx`) + the turn-level endpoint pinning
(`TurnEndpoints`) + the named floors + the ENUMERATED per-effect bridge family yields a GENUINE executor
run `execFullTurnA start acts = some fin` whose endpoints commit to the published turn-level

/-! ## §7 — the FAITHFUL transfer-tier note (the `e = 0` arm upgrade).

`kstepAll 0 = dispatchArm 0` lowers FROM the faithful `dispatchArmFacet` (the deployed two-axis
`authorizedFacetB` authority) by `RotatedKernelRefinementFacet.dispatchArmFacet_to_dispatchArm`. So the
transfer arm of the capstone is upgradable to the deployed authority tier — recorded as a lemma so the
faithful-tier path is explicit, not merely asserted. -/

/-- **`kstepAll_transfer_from_faithful` — the transfer arm lowers from the FAITHFUL facet arm.** A
faithful transfer step (`dispatchArmFacet`, authority via the deployed two-axis `authorizedFacetB`) at
the transfer tag `e = 0`, plus the toy-executor authority side-condition, entails the assembled
`kstepAll 0` arm. The faithful authority is the STRONGER fact; this records that the transfer slot of the
capstone carries the deployed-tier gate. -/

/-! ## §7b — `revokeCapability`: the SEVENTH fan-out tag, REACHABLE + bit-3 authority FORCED.

`revokeCapability` (Lean tag `24` = the wire `sel::REVOKE_CAPABILITY` selector; registry position `41`,
pinned by `Rfix_revokeCapability_capOpen`) is the cap-authorized REVOCATION whose authority binds the OWN
bit `EFF_REVOKE_CAPABILITY = 3` — DISTINCT from the `revoke(Delegation)` fan-out (`EFF_DELEGATION_OPS = 16`,
pos 39). At the KERNEL it shares the `revoke` removeEdge step (`RevokeSpec` — the same shared mutator that
`revoke`/`revokeDelegationA` lower to, `execFullA_revoke_iff_spec`/`execFullA_revokeDelegation_iff_spec`),
so its VALUE leg needs NO new executor action — it lowers to the GENUINE `.revoke` kernel step (`dispatchArm
2`). Only the AUTHORITY bit differs, and THAT is forced in-circuit at bit 3 from the live position-41 cap-open
descriptor (`revokeCapabilityCapOpenV3 = effCapOpenV3 revokeCapabilityBaseV3 … EFF_REVOKE_CAPABILITY`) via the
parametric `effAuthoritySource_authorizes` — exactly the mechanism the other 6 fan-out effects use, NOT the toy
gate, NOT a safely-rejected-but-unreachable keystone.

The reachability is GENUINE (not a fail-closed stub): a verifying `revokeCapability` turn yields a real
`removeEdge` kernel transition AT tag 2 (the shared revoke kind it executes as) with its OWN-bit authority
discharged from the in-circuit cap-open. -/
