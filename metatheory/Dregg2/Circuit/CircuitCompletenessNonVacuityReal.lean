# Dregg2.Circuit.CircuitCompletenessNonVacuityReal — completeness is NON-VACUOUS by a REAL transfer.

## What this closes (the upgrade over the empty-trace floor)

`CircuitCompletenessNonVacuity.satisfied2_transferV3_empty` inhabits `Satisfied2 hash transferV3 …`
with the EMPTY trace (`rows = []`). That refutes only "the type is `False`": every per-row gate is
`∀ i < 0`, vacuously true, so even a CONTRADICTORY gate set would admit the empty trace. The
meaningful question — are `transferV3`'s per-row gates JOINTLY SATISFIABLE by a trace that actually
COMPUTES a transfer — was witnessed only in Rust (the prove+verify roundtrips).

This module internalizes that satisfiability in Lean: it constructs a NON-EMPTY trace with ONE real
transfer row and proves `Satisfied2 hash transferV3 minit mfin maddrs realTransferTrace` for it.
`completeness_genuinely_nonvacuous` is the strictly-stronger statement: the gates are jointly
satisfiable by a NON-EMPTY real-row transfer (`∃ a trace with `rows ≠ []` satisfying `Satisfied2`).

## The concrete row (a genuine NATURAL debit + nonce tick — no `-1`, no full-drain)

`transferV3 = graduateV1 (rotateV3FrozenAuthority transferVmDescriptor)`. The Lean per-row
`transition` constraint is UNCONDITIONAL on row 0 (`env.nxt (sbCol i) = env.loc (saCol i)` on the
ACTIVE row, since `isLast = false` there): it ties row 0's AFTER-state to the WRAP row's BEFORE-state.
The earlier (degenerate) witness used a zero wrap row, which forced row 0's after-state to ALL-ZERO and
so demanded a full-drain `bal 10 → 0` with a `nonce -1 → 0`. THIS witness carries row 0's REAL
after-state in the WRAP row's before block, so a NATURAL transfer is the active-row-0 witness:

  * row 0 (`isFirst = true`, `isLast = false`): the GENUINE transfer row.
    * `s_transfer = 1`, `s_noop = 0` (a real transfer row, not a pad);
    * BEFORE: `bal_lo = 100`, `nonce = 0`, all other state limbs `0`;
    * AFTER: `bal_lo = 90`, `nonce = 1`, all other state limbs `0`;
    * params: `amount = 10`, `direction = 1` (an OUTGOING transfer — a debit).
  * row 1 (`isLast = true`): the WRAP row. Its per-row `.gate`/`.transition`/weld constraints are
    VACUOUS; it CARRIES row 0's after-state in its BEFORE block (`sbCol BALANCE_LO = 90`,
    `sbCol NONCE = 1`) so row 0's transition `wrap.before[i] = row0.after[i]` holds; its OWN after /
    rotated-after limbs are `0` (the boundary-LAST pins read those, matching `realPub` there).

Then the transfer arithmetic is GENUINELY exercised on row 0:
  * `gBalLo`: `after.bal_lo (90) = before.bal_lo (100) + amount (10)·(1 - 2·dir (1)) = 100 - 10 = 90` ✓
    — a real debit of `10`, balance `100 → 90`;
  * `gNonce` (active, `s_noop = 0`): `after.nonce (1) = before.nonce (0) + 1` ✓ — a real nonce tick
    `0 → 1`;
  * `gDirBool`: `dir (1)·(dir - 1) = 0` ✓;
  * `gBalHi`/`gCapPass`/`gResPass`/the 8 `gFieldPass`: `0 = 0` (frame frozen at zero) ✓.

Both after-balance limbs are range-checked: `bal_lo = 90 ∈ [0, 2^30)`, `bal_hi = 0 ∈ [0, 2^30)` ✓.
This demonstrates a REAL transfer is inhabitable: no `-1` nonce, no full drain.

## The auxiliary tables (lookups by literal membership; NO chip-soundness needed)

`Satisfied2`'s lookup leg is `Lookup.holdsAt tf env l := l.tuple.map (·.eval env.loc) ∈ tf l.table` —
PURE membership; it does NOT require `ChipTableSound`. So the Poseidon2 chip table and the range table
are constructed AS the list of the row's own evaluated lookup tuples (`tfReal`): every lookup hits its
own tuple by `List.mem_filterMap`. (The chip-soundness `out == permOut(ins)` is the SEPARATE soundness
direction; the completeness/satisfiability direction only needs the table to CONTAIN the looked-up
rows, which the honest prover's chip table does.) The memory / map-ops legs collapse exactly as in the
empty case: `graduateV1` emits no mem/map ops, so `memLog`/`mapLog` are empty and `tf .memory = []`,
`tf .mapOps = []` (the `filterMap` skips them — no `.memory`/`.mapOps` lookup exists), against the
empty boundary `maddrs = []`.

/-! ## §1 — the generic lookup-table-faithfulness machinery.

`Satisfied2`'s `rowConstraints` quantifies the per-row constraints over the whole trace; the lookup
constraints want their evaluated tuple to be a row of the named auxiliary table. We BUILD the table
as exactly the row's own evaluated lookup tuples, so membership is `List.mem_filterMap`. -/

lookup constraint `.lookup l ∈ d.constraints`, the evaluated tuple `l.tuple.map (·.eval a)` is the
`filterMap` image of that very constraint, so it is a member of `tfOf d a l.table`. -/

A single transfer row, columns set to the genuine debit values; everything unmentioned is `0`. The
rotated welded limbs `r0 ↔ bal_lo` (col 189) and `r1 ↔ nonce` (col 190) carry the BEFORE-state
balance/nonce (so the `weldsAt` `colEq` ties hold); the after block and all other rotated/caveat
limbs are `0`. -/

/-- The concrete real NATURAL transfer row (`Assignment`): `s_transfer = 1`, before-`bal_lo = 100`,
before-`nonce = 0`, after-`bal_lo = 90`, after-`nonce = 1`, `amount = 10`, `direction = 1`; the
two welded BEFORE rotated limbs `r0`(col 189)`= bal_lo = 100` and `r1`(col 190)`= nonce = 0`; all
other limbs `0`. (`after.nonce = 1` rides `saCol NONCE`; `after.bal_lo = 90` rides `saCol BALANCE_LO`.) -/

  else if v = sbCol state.BALANCE_LO then 100   -- col 54 (before bal_lo)
  else if v = saCol state.BALANCE_LO then 90    -- col 76 (after bal_lo)

read columns that are `0` on `realRow` except `INIT_BAL_LO (= before bal_lo = 100)` (and
`ACTOR_NONCE = before nonce = 0`). The last-row pins (`state_commit → NEW_COMMIT`,
`bal_lo/bal_hi → FINAL_*`) plus the four rotated commit pins read the WRAP row's after / rotated-after
limbs, all `0` there. -/

state. Under the deployed `when_transition()` denotation the wrap row's OWN per-row `.gate`/
`.transition`/weld constraints are VACUOUS (`isLast = true`); its OWN after / rotated-after limbs are
`0` (the boundary-LAST pins read those, matching `realPub = 0` there). The real transfer rides the
ACTIVE (first) row, where the gates GENUINELY bite — and the after-state is a genuine `90 / nonce 1`. -/

last row, where gates are vacuous; it carries row 0's after-state in its before block). The auxiliary
table is the union of both rows' evaluated lookup tuples (`tfOf2`), so every chip / range lookup hits
on whichever row carries it. The active first row exercises the real transfer; the wrap row makes the
unconditional row-0 transition land on the GENUINE after-state, not on zero. -/

gate set would still admit the empty trace — but it would NOT admit THIS real row, whose gates are all
