# Dregg2.Circuit.ShieldedOnRampPin — the shielded VALUE ON-RAMP boundary: what Shield/Deshield
  must enforce, why the CURRENT `note_shielded` append cannot enforce it, and the exact aliasing
  hazard the two value encodings open at the boundary.

**The lane.** `docs/DESIGN-shielded-value-on-ramp.md` §4 names this file as the recommended next
byte-safe step: *"Lean `ShieldedOnRampPin.lean` (boundary conservation model + falsifier)"*, with §5.1
adding *"the on-ramp must either carry the value in the 16-lane wide encoding or cap shieldable
amounts. Not resolved by this design. **It is the first thing the Lean lane should model.**"* Both are
modeled here.

House-law-1 said out loud: **the on-ramp AIR is Lean-authored.** This module is the metatheory of the
boundary — the obligation and its falsifier. It authors no descriptor and touches no deployed byte;
the emitted objects it composes with (`Emit.ShieldedSpendDescriptor`, `Emit.ShieldedNoteAppendDescriptor`)
are already Lean-authored. Nothing here licenses a hand-written Rust gadget.

## What is proved

**§1 — the boundary transition and its conservation obligation, over ℤ.** A `Shield` moves one
cleartext note of `u64` value `v` out of `note_commitments` and mints the Poseidon2 note commitment
`hash_fact(v,[asset,owner,rand])` into `note_shielded`, with `v` PUBLIC at entry (Shield-A, DESIGN
§2.2). `step_conserves_supply` / `run_conserves_supply` prove the total supply
`Σ cleartext + Σ shielded` is invariant across any run of Shield/Deshield steps — as an **ℤ equality**,
not a congruence. `shield_leaving_eq_entering` states the per-step obligation exactly: the amount
leaving cleartext = the amount entering shielded = the public `v`, in ℤ. `modp_identity_is_not_the_obligation`
shows why the "as ℤ" is load-bearing: `0` and `p` are congruent mod p, both are `u64`, and they are
not equal — a mod-p identity is not a conservation identity.

**§2 — THE FALSIFIER: the current GATE-4 append cannot establish membership soundness.**
`apply.rs:1849` appends `ShieldedNoteCommitment(leg.commitment_bytes)` — the prover's wire bytes,
verbatim (a compressed Ristretto Pedersen *value* commitment). `deployed_append_leaf_is_wire_verbatim`
and `deployed_append_is_free` state that the appended membership leaf is an unconstrained function of
the wire: for every target the prover has a wire value that lands it. Consequently
`deployed_append_unsound` proves `AccumulatorSound` is **FALSE** for the resulting root, and
`deployed_append_unsound_today` proves it with **zero hypotheses** at the deployed reality (no `Shield`
effect exists, so the set of ledger-authorized shielded notes is EMPTY — DESIGN §0.1 *"value has never
entered the shielded pool"*). `l4_pin_over_deployed_append_relocates_15` is the load-bearing
composition: an L4 pin to *that* root is satisfied by a spend of a note no gate ever authorized — the
pin holds and the theft still lands. **#15 relocates one level up; it does not close.**

**§2.1 — a sharpening of the design's own claim (a partial refutation, reported not buried).** DESIGN
§3.3 prices the wound as *"`AccumulatorSound` is FALSE … that is exactly the `NoteAccumulatorCR`
hypothesis"*, where `NoteAccumulatorCR`'s note predicate is the ∃-image
`IsCommittedNote hash leaf := ∃ v as ow rd, leaf ≡ hash_fact(v,[as,ow,rd])`. That predicate **cannot**
price it: `noteAccumulatorCR_vacuous_of_c6Surjective` proves that if the C6 site is mod-p surjective in
its preimages — which a real Poseidon2 with four free field inputs onto a ~2^31 codomain is expected to
be — then `NoteAccumulatorCR` holds **for every root, including the prover-written one**. The
∃-image is satisfied by "some opening exists", never "an opening the ledger authorized". So the
falsifier is stated at the predicate that carries the content, `IsLedgerNote` (the leaf is the
commitment of a preimage the boundary gate approved), where it is unconditional; the literal
`IsCommittedNote` form is also proved (`deployed_append_breaks_noteAccumulatorCR`), under the
explicitly named non-surjectivity hypothesis it genuinely needs.

**§3 — THE FIX, SOUND.** Shield-A appends `noteLeaf hash n` for a preimage `n` the boundary gate
authorized, so `shieldAppend_is_ledger_note` is by construction (no crypto). Feeding that construction
fact into the landed `ShieldedSpendPortResidual.noteAccumulatorCR_of_hashFloor` gives
`shieldA_noteAccumulatorCR` — `NoteAccumulatorCR` **HOLDS** over the Shield-A accumulated set under the
single named Poseidon2 floor `FoldReachIsMember` (the Merkle-root binding floor, not a per-leaf
assumption). `shieldA_pin_spends_authorized` is the strictly stronger conclusion the `IsLedgerNote`
predicate buys: a pinned-and-accepted spend spends a note the ledger AUTHORIZED, not merely one that
has some opening. `shieldA_pin_closes_15` composes with the landed
`ShieldedSpendPortDischarge.pin_accept_is_note_committed`, and `deshield_publishes_an_entered_value`
is the exit statement: a `Deshield` can only publish the value of a note a `Shield` entered.

**§4 — THE VALUE-ALIASING TOOTH.** The two sides of the boundary reduce the same `u64` differently:
the committed CLEARTEXT leaf column carries `split_u64(value).0` = the **low 30 bits**
(`circuit/src/effect_vm/helpers.rs:13-17`, `cell/src/commitment_set.rs:262`), while the shielded C6
opening reduces the value **mod p** (`p = 2013265921 < 2^31`). `boundary_images_alias_both_ways`
exhibits `u64` pairs aliased by each image and separated by the other. `aliased_shield_inflates` is the
concrete inflation: a shield whose conservation check runs on the cleartext leaf's own value column
mints `2^30` units from a note worth `0`, and `supply` strictly increases — the ℤ-invariant of §1 is
broken by exactly `2^30`. Two closures are proved: `cap_closes_aliased_shield` (an amount cap
`v < 2^30` makes both images injective, so the aliased check IS the exact check) and
`wide4_injective_on_u64` (the deployed 16-bit-limb `u64` encoding — `U64_LIMBS = 4`, `LIMB_BITS = 16`,
`circuit-prove/src/shielded/wide_value_binding.rs:37-40` — is injective on the whole `u64` range, and
`wide4_separates_the_alias` shows it separates the very pair the leaf column conflates).

**§7 — THE ROUTING OBLIGATION (added 2026-08-06): "source `piCOMMITTED` from `note_shielded.root8()`"
is NOT a wiring change.** The L4 route the frontier proposes — feed the emitted `shieldedSpendDesc`
membership pin the committed accumulator root — is obstructed THREE ways at once, each a named
theorem: `route_fold_8to1_collides` (WIDTH: the 8-lane `note_shielded` root does not injectively fit
the descriptor's single `piCOMMITTED` lane), `plain_fold_is_not_indexed_merkle` (STRUCTURE: the
descriptor's plain 4-ary fold `Hair` is a different function from the accumulator's indexed-Merkle
`next_addr`-linked fold), and — reusing §2's `deployed_append_is_free` — the LEAF-OBJECT mismatch
(the appended accumulator leaf is a free wire, not the descriptor's `noteLeaf`). `route_root8_as_piCOMMITTED_needs_reencoding`
composes the three: the sound route requires FIRST re-encoding descriptor-membership and
accumulator-append to ONE object — the VK-affecting L0.5 encoding decision (ember-gated; DESIGN §3,
frontier §2). This arms the exact trap so no lane silently routes the mismatched descriptor.

## Scope (honest)

This is the metatheory of the boundary, NOT the boundary. It does **not** implement `Effect::Shield` /
`Effect::Deshield` (wire + `effects_hash` + a descriptor rung = VK-affecting, ember-gated per DESIGN
§4), does **not** fix the GATE-4 append, and emits no descriptor. The `Shield-A` append modeled in §3
is the object `Emit.ShieldedNoteAppendDescriptor` (L2) forces in-AIR — the correspondence is a NAMING
here, not a bridge; bridging the AAFI/sorted-tree append model to this `foldPath` membership model is
the named next lane. Crypto enters only as NAMED hypotheses: `FoldReachIsMember` (Poseidon2
Merkle-binding, the landed floor — itself realized over a real committed accumulator under `HairCR` by
`ShieldedSpendFoldReachRealized.foldReachIsMember_realized`, so §3's floor is a reduction, not a fresh
assumption) and `C6Surjective` (a property OF Poseidon2, used only to show a hypothesis is not free).
No `sorry`, no `admit`, no `native_decide`.

/-! ## §1 — the boundary transition and its conservation obligation, over ℤ.

Faithful to DESIGN §2.2 (Shield-A) and §2.5 (Deshield): a shield consumes ONE cleartext note through
the existing FNSP gates and mints ONE shielded note commitment, with the amount PUBLIC at entry; a
deshield is the mirror. The note's `u64` value is modeled as `ℕ` (the `u64` bound enters only where it
is load-bearing, §4); the other three fields are field elements, as the C6 opening sees them. -/

/-- A note preimage as the boundary gate sees it: the `u64` amount plus the three C6 fields. This is
the opening of the Poseidon2 note commitment `hash_fact(value, [asset, owner, randomness])` — the

/-- The boundary state: the live cleartext notes (`note_commitments`, the side the shield spends from)
and the openings of the shielded set's leaves (`note_shielded`). The shielded list is the GHOST

nullifier consumed through the existing FNSP gates) and the SAME opening enters `note_shielded`, with
the public entry amount `v` tied to the note's value (`hpub` — DESIGN §2.2's *"`value_in == value` as a
plain `u64` equality the executor checks in the clear"*). `deshield` is the mirror (DESIGN §2.5). The
public amount is carried explicitly so the obligation is stated over the value the boundary PUBLISHES,
not over an unobservable one. -/

the amount LEAVING the cleartext side equals the amount ENTERING the shielded side equals the PUBLIC
entry amount `v` — all three as **ℤ** equalities. This is the conservation content of the boundary in
one line; §2 is about the gate that must force it and §4 about the encoding that can defeat it. -/

/-- **`step_conserves_supply`.** Every boundary step — shield or deshield — preserves the ℤ total
supply. The pool is a black box that publishes `Σ shielded-in` and `Σ shielded-out` in the clear
(DESIGN §2.5's *"resulting global property"*), and the box neither mints nor burns. -/

both are representable `u64` amounts, and they are NOT equal. A boundary identity checked mod p
therefore admits a `p`-unit mint. (`2013265921 < 2^64`.) -/

/-! ## §2 — THE FALSIFIER: the CURRENT append writes the prover's wire bytes, so the accumulated set
establishes nothing.

    set.insert(commitment)…;
}
```

Ground-truthed at HEAD: GATE 1 (`verify_stark_with_wide_bindings`) proves the INPUTS' membership and
nullifiers against `payload.merkle_root` — itself a wire felt (#15). GATE 2
(`verify_full_conservation_bytes`) constrains the output legs only as **Pedersen** objects: a Ristretto
point with a Bulletproof range proof, summing to the inputs' commitments. The prover chooses the
blinding freely, so the appended 32 bytes are prover-determined; **nothing anywhere ties them to the
image of `hash_fact(value,[asset,owner,rand])`, and nothing ties them to a note any ledger gate
authorized.** -/

/-- **The predicate that carries the content: `IsLedgerNote`.** A leaf is a genuine shielded note iff it
is the C6 commitment of a preimage the boundary gate AUTHORIZED (`auth n` — the source cleartext note
was spent through the FNSP gates and the public entry amount checked). This is strictly stronger than
`IsCommittedNote`, which asks only that SOME opening exist — see §2.1 for why that difference is the

DESIGN §3.3 prices the wound as *"`AccumulatorSound` is FALSE … exactly the `NoteAccumulatorCR`
hypothesis `pin_accept_is_note_committed` requires"*. `NoteAccumulatorCR`'s note predicate is the
∃-image `IsCommittedNote`. The falsifier IS provable there — but only under a hypothesis that is NOT
free at a real Poseidon2, which is the honest sharpening this lane owes the design. -/

/-- **`deployed_append_breaks_noteAccumulatorCR` — the falsifier in the design's own words.** If the
appended wire value is outside the C6 image, `NoteAccumulatorCR` is FALSE for the post-append root:
the value in the set is not any note's commitment. Hash-agnostic, over all paths. -/

satisfied by the wound it was supposed to price: it asks that *some* opening exist, never that the
LEDGER authorized one. This does not weaken §2 — `deployed_append_unsound_today` stands with no

boundary gate validated, appended at the free index of `note_shielded` with `piROOT_BEFORE`
EXECUTOR-sourced. In-AIR this is `Emit.ShieldedNoteAppendDescriptor` (L2). Here: the construction fact
the append supplies, composed with the landed floor reduction. -/

/-- **The Shield-A append (DESIGN §2.4).** The minted leaf is the C6 commitment of the authorized
opening — never a wire byte string. -/
def shieldAppendLeaf (hash : List ℤ → ℤ) (n : Note) : ℤ := noteLeaf hash n

/-- **`shieldAppend_is_ledger_note` — the construction fact, no crypto.** What Shield-A appends is a
ledger-authorized note commitment, because the gate appends the commitment of the opening it just
authorized. This is precisely `noteAccumulatorCR_of_hashFloor`'s `members_are_notes` premise, and it is
exactly what the deployed append cannot supply. -/
theorem shieldAppend_is_ledger_note (hash : List ℤ → ℤ) (auth : Note → Prop) (n : Note) (hn : auth n) :
    IsLedgerNote hash auth (shieldAppendLeaf hash n) :=
  ⟨n, hn, Int.ModEq.refl _⟩

/-- Every member of the Shield-A accumulated set is an `IsCommittedNote` — the honest construction
premise of the landed floor reduction, discharged. -/
theorem shieldA_members_are_notes (hash : List ℤ → ℤ) (auth : Note → Prop) :
    ∀ leaf, IsLedgerNote hash auth leaf → IsCommittedNote hash leaf :=
  ledgerNote_isCommittedNote hash auth

/-- **⚑ THE FIX SOUND (`shieldA_noteAccumulatorCR`).** With the Shield-A append, `NoteAccumulatorCR`
**HOLDS** for the accumulated root under the SINGLE named Poseidon2 floor `FoldReachIsMember` (the
Merkle-root binding floor: only a genuine member folds to the committed root — the `SpineCommits8` /
`Compress8CR` shape, not an unbounded per-leaf assumption). The hypothesis `pin_accept_is_note_committed`
requires is now DISCHARGED, modulo one named hash floor — which is what "the pin closes #15" means. -/

  noteAccumulatorCR_of_hashFloor hash committedRoot (IsLedgerNote hash auth)
    (shieldA_members_are_notes hash auth) floor

/-- **⚑ THE STRONGER CONCLUSION (`shieldA_pin_spends_authorized`).** Under the same floor, a pinned and
accepted spend spends a note the LEDGER AUTHORIZED — not merely one for which some opening exists. This
is the conclusion the deployed append cannot reach at any hash, and the one `IsLedgerNote` was
introduced to state. -/

  exact floor p.leaf p.path (by rw [hmem, hpin])

/-- **⚑ THE COMPOSITION (`shieldA_pin_closes_15`).** Both halves at once, over the landed objects: a
pinned-accepted spend against the Shield-A accumulator spends a note that is (a) a genuine C6
commitment — via the landed `ShieldedSpendPortDischarge.pin_accept_is_note_committed`, whose
`NoteAccumulatorCR` floor is now discharged rather than assumed — and (b) ledger-authorized. -/

   shieldA_pin_spends_authorized hash auth committedRoot floor p h⟩

/-- **`deshield_publishes_an_entered_value` (the exit, DESIGN §2.5).** A `Deshield` whose membership is
pinned to the Shield-A accumulator can only publish the value of a note a `Shield` actually entered:
the spent leaf opens to an authorized preimage. This is what makes L4's pin non-vacuous — and it is the
in-AIR half of §1's `run_conserves_supply`. -/

/-! ## §4 — THE VALUE-ALIASING TOOTH: two encodings of one `u64` at one boundary.

DESIGN §5.1, the open tension this lane owes an answer to. The committed CLEARTEXT leaf carries
`split_u64(value).0` — the **low 30 bits** of the `u64`
(`circuit/src/effect_vm/helpers.rs:13-17`: `let lo = (val & 0x3FFF_FFFF) as u32;`, used at
`cell/src/commitment_set.rs:262` as the accumulator leaf's value column). The shielded C6 opening
carries the value as a BabyBear felt, i.e. reduced **mod p**, `p = 2013265921 < 2^31`. Neither
faithfully represents a `u64`, and they are DIFFERENT reductions. -/

/-- The image of a `u64` amount in the committed CLEARTEXT leaf's value column: the low 30 bits,
`split_u64(value).0`. -/

/-- The image of a `u64` amount in the SHIELDED C6 opening: the value reduced mod p. -/
def shieldFeltImage (v : ℕ) : ℤ := (v : ℤ) % P

/-- **⚑ THE ALIASING, both ways (`boundary_images_alias_both_ways`).** The two boundary images of a
`u64` amount conflate DIFFERENT pairs: `2^30` and `0` are identical to the cleartext leaf column and
distinct to the shielded opening; `p` and `0` are identical to the shielded opening and distinct to the
cleartext leaf column. So there is no single "boundary image" of a value, and a conservation check run
on either one alone admits an amount the other would reject. -/

/-- **The aliased shield step.** The boundary gate's conservation check is performed on the value the
committed CLEARTEXT leaf can actually see — its low-30-bit column — rather than on the `u64`. The
spent note keeps its true value; the minted shielded note carries `vMint`, and the gate accepts because
the two agree in the leaf column. Everything else is the honest `Step.shield`. -/

/-! ## §7 — THE ROUTING OBLIGATION: the emitted descriptor's membership object is NOT the committed
`note_shielded` root, so "route `piCOMMITTED` from `note_shielded.root8()`" is unsound as-is.

Source, verified at HEAD 2026-08-06:
  * the emitted spend descriptor pins membership via the PLAIN 4-ary fold
    `Hair hash cur lvl = hash_fact(cur,[sib0,sib1,sib2,pos])` to a SINGLE PI lane `piCOMMITTED`
    (`Emit/ShieldedSpendDescriptor.lean:158,212`; the root-bound adapter binds only
    `ROOT_BOUND_LANES = 2` single lanes, retired `shielded_spend_leaf_adapter.rs` former line 610);
  * the committed `note_shielded` accumulator produces an EIGHT-lane root
    (`exact_linked_append_root8 : … → Digest8`, `ROOT_LANES = 8`, `TREE_DEPTH = 16`,
    `circuit/src/exact_nullifier_aafi.rs:34,36`) via a depth-16 INDEXED-MERKLE sorted-linked leaf
    whose stored object is `fold(Ristretto commitment_bytes)` with a ZERO value column
    (`cell/src/shielded_note_set.rs`).

So the L4 route is three mismatches — WIDTH (8→1), STRUCTURE (plain 4-ary vs indexed-Merkle), and
LEAF OBJECT (`noteLeaf` vs a free wire) — each proved below to obstruct a sound pin. The route is
sound only AFTER descriptor-membership and accumulator-append are re-encoded to one object: the
VK-affecting L0.5 encoding decision (ember-gated: DESIGN §3, frontier §2). -/

/-- **⚑ WIDTH (`route_fold_8to1_collides`).** Both natural single-felt collapses of the 8-lane
committed root are non-injective — two DISTINCT 8-lane roots share one `piCOMMITTED` image — so
pinning to the collapsed value does not bind the committed root: a forged 8-lane root with the same
image passes the pin. (The general fact is pigeonhole over the finite field, `p^8 > p` — the ~31-bit
width §4 is about, now at the root pin rather than the value column.) -/

descriptor to the indexed-Merkle committed root rejects the accumulator's honest members (the effect
goes dead), independent of the width collapse. -/

obstructions, faithful to the deployed FSI2/FSN2/FSE2 exact-linked geometry.

Ember greenlit **Fork B**: KEEP the depth-16 indexed-Merkle sorted-linked accumulator
(`cell/src/shielded_note_set.rs`, `exact_linked_append_root8` at FSI2/FSN2/FSE2 — preserving
duplicate-rejection / the absence bracket) and make the DESCRIPTOR commensurate with it. This section
is the machine-checked OBLIGATION the re-authored emitted descriptor must realize: the exact 8-lane
fold it must pin `piCOMMITTED` to. Geometry recon-verified against `circuit/src/exact_nullifier_aafi.rs`:
  * LEAF preimage = 39 felts `[FSI2] ++ addrTag :: addr[16] ++ value[4] ++ nextTag :: next[16]`,
    through `hash_many_8` (`:494-515`);
  * NODE preimage = 33 felts `[FSN2] ++ child0[8] ++ child1[8] ++ child2[8] ++ child3[8]`, through
    `hash_many_8` (`:522-545`); arity 4, depth 16, `ROOT_LANES = 8` (`:34-36`);
  * the shielded leaf's `addr` is the 32-byte note commitment as sixteen `u16` LE limbs, value
    column ZERO (hiding) — `cell/src/shielded_note_set.rs:123-138,351-359`.

**Scope, said out loud.** This is the metatheory of the pin, NOT the pin. It does NOT emit a

realization is a ~2442-column exact-linked AIR at the shielded domain (adapting
`Emit/ExactNullifierAafiDescriptorPlan.lean` from FNI2 to FSI2, chained `TID_P2_STATE16` steps —
`TID_P2`'s 8-lane single-permutation output cannot express the `hash_many_8` sponge); that, plus the
state-commitment change, the route + `spend_circuit.rs` deletion, and Shield/Deshield, are the named

to all 8 lanes binds the committed root — `route_fold_8to1_collides`'s collapse is unrepresentable. -/

children where `Hair` hashes a 7-felt `hash_fact` block, and its LEAF preimage is 39 felts carrying a
`next_addr` link — the indexed-Merkle distinguishing input `Hair` lacks. The width gap exhibits the
distinction, so `plain_fold_is_not_indexed_merkle` is answered by CONSTRUCTING the commensurate fold. -/

/-- **⚑ FORK B COMMENSURATION OBLIGATION (`reencoded_fold_commensurates`).** The re-encoded fold
`foldPath8` with an 8-lane `piCOMMITTED` pin closes both §7 obstructions that made routing the OLD
descriptor unsound: WIDTH (`pin8_separates_the_collapsed_alias`) and STRUCTURE (the node/leaf are the
exact-linked 33/39 shapes, not `Hair`'s 7). The THIRD obstruction, LEAF, is discharged by the
Shield-A append committing `noteLeaf` (§3 `shieldAppend_is_ledger_note`) as the exact-linked leaf's
`addr` — the coupling to the value on-ramp. When an emitted descriptor pins `foldPath8`'s 8-lane root
to `piCOMMITTED` sourced from `note_shielded.root8()`, the route is sound. THIS is that pin's spec;
realizing it as an emitted `EffectVmDescriptor2` is the named next step. -/
