# Dregg2.Circuit.RotatedKernelRefinementFacet — the AUTHORITY leg of the soundness apex, closed
faithfully for `transfer` (the template the ~29 other effects follow).

## What this module closes (the authority leg)

`RotatedKernelRefinement.lean` builds the VALUE rung: the live rotated transfer circuit FORCES the
debit/credit movement + availability (`transfer_descriptorRefines` against `BalanceMovementSpec`).
But its AUTHORITY conjunct rides the TOY `admitGuardA`/`authorizedB` (`authorizedB k.caps t`) as a
carried `rotatedEncodes.guardAuth` field — the toy `Cap.node`/`Auth.write` shadow, not the deployed
two-axis (tier × facet) gate.

This module repoints that conjunct onto the FAITHFUL `authorizedFacetB`
(`Dregg2.Exec.FacetAuthority`), and DISCHARGES it — no longer carried — from the IN-CIRCUIT cap-open
the descriptor now realizes (`CapOpenEmit.transferCapOpenEffV3_authorizes` — the LIVE membership
descriptor the deployed prover routes through). It is PURELY ADDITIVE: the toy `BalanceMovementSpec`,
`admitGuardA`, `authorizedB`, and the ~150 modules that read them are UNTOUCHED.

## What is built (the three rungs of the prompt)

  1. **`BalanceMovementSpecFacetK`** (over `FacetKernelState`) + **`execFaithful_iff_specFacet`** —
     the FAITHFUL executor (`FacetAuthority.execFaithful`, which gates on `authorizedFacetB`) ⟺ the
     FAITHFUL full-state spec, BOTH directions. The authority conjunct is
     `authorizedFacetB k.fcaps provided turn = true` over the deployed FACET caps. This is the
     executor corner of the faithful triangle (the §10(A) `exec_authorized` made a ⟺).

  2. **`BalanceMovementSpecFacet`** (over `RecChainedState`, parameterized by the deployed
     `fcaps`/`provided`) + **`transfer_descriptorRefines_facet`** — the TEMPLATE keystone. Identical
     to `BalanceMovementSpec` EXCEPT the `admitGuardA` authority conjunct is
     `authorizedFacetB fcaps provided tr = true`. The VALUE leg (debit/credit/availability/frame/log)
     is REUSED verbatim from `RotatedKernelRefinement` via `transfer_descriptorRefines`; the AUTHORITY
     leg is FORCED by the cap-open (`capOpen_authorizes ⟹ authorizedFacetB`), discharged from the
     decoded `fcaps` wired to the cap-open's opened leaf — NOT a carried assumption.

  3. **`dispatchArmFacet`** + **`lightclient_transfer_faithful` / `lightclient_transfer_faithful_forest`**
     — the apex (`CircuitSoundness.lightclient_unfoolable` / `lightclient_turn_unfoolable_forest`)
     instantiated at `kstep := dispatchArmFacet`, whose `.balanceA` arm is `BalanceMovementSpecFacet`.
     The apex now concludes a FAITHFUL kernel transition for a transfer turn: the authority leg is the
     deployed two-axis gate, discharged by the in-circuit cap-open.

## The `StateDecode ↔ cap-open` wiring (the named bridge — NOT assumed)

The apex hands the rung a `StateDecode S pc pre post` (the published-commitment binding) and a
`Satisfied2 hash transferV3` witness. The VALUE leg needs the `rotatedEncodes` boundary decode; the
AUTHORITY leg needs the cap-open `Satisfied` row + the deployed-faithfulness `DeployedFaithful` for
the decoded `fcaps`, plus the `(actor ⇒ src)` edge identification. None of these are derivable from
`StateDecode` alone (the commitment surface commits the LEDGER, not the cap-tree's leaf assignment
nor the `fcaps`). So they are bundled as ONE named bridge `TransferAuthoritySource` (§2), exactly the
genuine residual the commitment cannot certify — named, not laundered. The authority CONCLUSION
(`authorizedFacetB`) is then DERIVED inside, FROM the cap-open, not taken as a field.

## Residual ledger (carried, named — not faked)

  * **The tier is `Signature`** (`provided := .signature`): the in-circuit `authTagGate` pins
    `auth_tag = 1`, so the cap-open discharges `authorizedFacetB … .signature …`. Reading the tier
    generically off the committed `auth_tag` is the `FacetAuthority §10` named residual.
  * **The `Custom`-tier vk decode** (`vkOfTag`): transfers never use `Custom` (tag ≠ 5), so it is
    inert here; carried as the named felt-absorb residual.
  * **`TransferAuthoritySource`** (the §2 bridge): the cap-open `Satisfied` row, the deployed
    faithfulness, and the edge identification — the genuine cap-tree residual the LEDGER commitment
    cannot carry. The authority CONCLUSION is forced from it; the bridge itself is the realizability
    of the prover's cap-tree opening (REALIZABLE — the honest prover opens the actor's real cap).

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound} + the named carriers inherited through the
imported keystones (`StarkSound`, `Poseidon2SpongeCR`, the cap-hash `chipCR`/`Compress1CR`, the
chip-soundness `ChipTableSound`). NEW names only; imports are read-only.

The faithful executor `FacetAuthority.execFaithful` gates on the deployed two-axis `authorizedFacetB
k.fcaps provided turn` (NOT the toy `authorizedB`). `BalanceMovementSpecFacetK` is its full-state
declarative post-condition: the deployed-authority guard holds, the post-`bal` ledger is the
debit/credit movement, and the FRAME — the live `accounts` and the FACET cap-table `fcaps` — is
unchanged. `execFaithful_iff_specFacet` is the executor⟺spec, BOTH directions: the `→` VALIDATES the
faithful executor against the independent spec (a silently mutated `fcaps`/`accounts` would fail the
proof); the `←` reconstructs the committed state. -/

/-- **`BalanceMovementSpecFacetK`** — the FULL-state declarative spec of a committed faithful transfer

/-! ## §3 — the `StateDecode ↔ cap-open` bridge: `TransferAuthoritySource`.

The apex hands the rung a `StateDecode S pc pre post` + a `Satisfied2 hash transferV3 …` witness. The
VALUE leg of the faithful spec is forced by `RotatedKernelRefinement.transfer_descriptorRefines`,
which needs a `rotatedEncodes pre post` boundary decode. The AUTHORITY leg needs the cap-open's
`authorizedFacetB`, which the live descriptor's cap-open realizes — but to fire
`transferCapOpenEffV3_authorizes` we need its row data: the cap-open `Satisfied2` (the descriptor's
appendix is satisfied), the chip-table soundness, the deployed `DeployedFaithful` for the decoded
`fcaps`, and the `(actor ⇒ src)` edge identification (`hsrc`/`hedge`). NONE of these is derivable
from `StateDecode` (the commitment surface commits the LEDGER, not the cap-tree leaf assignment).

`TransferAuthoritySource` bundles EXACTLY that residual — the genuine cap-tree data the ledger
commitment cannot carry — as ONE named bridge. The authority CONCLUSION (`authorizedFacetB`) is then
DERIVED from it (`authoritySource_authorizes`), not taken as a field. -/

/-- **`TransferAuthoritySource hash fcaps pre tr` — the cap-open authority source (NAMED, not faked).**
The realizability of the prover's IN-CIRCUIT cap-tree opening for the transfer's authority: a cap-open
`Satisfied2` witness of the live cap-open descriptor (against a sound chip table) whose opened leaf IS
the deployed-faithful `(actor ⇒ src)` edge, with the decoded `fcaps` the deployed faithfulness backs.
The authority conclusion is FORCED from these (via `transferCapOpenEffV3_authorizes`); they are the
cap-tree residual the ledger commitment cannot certify — carried, named (exactly as `StarkSound` is).
DATA-bearing (`Type`, like `rotatedEncodes`): it exhibits the cap-open trace + row + leaf assignment,

do NOT collapse to `authorizedFacetB`; their authority is the GENERAL `authorizedFacetEffB caps provided
(1 <<< n)` at the effect's OWN bit `n` — exactly what a per-effect authority gate needs. `EffAuthoritySource`
generalizes the cap-open source to ANY fan-out descriptor `effCapOpenV3 base name n` at bit `n`, deriving
`authorizedFacetEffB caps provided (1 <<< n)` from the in-circuit open (via `effCapOpenV3_authorizes`).

/-! ## §7.D — DISCHARGE the carried `hfaith` field: build the authority source from CR + the CANONICAL
cap-tree, not from an assumed `DeployedFaithfulEff`.

`EffAuthoritySource.hfaith` (and `TransferAuthoritySource(G).hfaith`) carry `DeployedFaithfulEff` as an
ASSUMED structure FIELD over a FREE `leafAt` — the soundness analog of the completeness laundering. The
discharge lives in `DeployedCapTree.deployedFaithfulEff_canonical`: for the CANONICAL leaf function the
cap-tree actually commits (`canonicalLeafAt caps`, built FROM the c-list — the cap-tree analog of
`recStateCommit`'s "leaves from the kernel"), `DeployedFaithfulEff` holds UNCONDITIONALLY (the `backed`
witness is read off the construction's `find?`), modulo only the named `Custom`/`vkOfTag` residual.

`effAuthoritySource_ofCanonical` constructs the `EffAuthoritySource` with that DISCHARGED `hfaith`:
the caller supplies the cap-open trace data (`Satisfied2` + chip soundness — the genuine in-circuit
membership the apex needs) and the IPC-tier side condition, NOT an independent faithful-encoding contract.
The `leafAt` is PINNED to `canonicalLeafAt caps` (so `hedge` becomes "the prover opens the CANONICAL
leaf", the realizable honest-prover identification — not a free leaf assignment). This shrinks the
carried-floor set: `hfaith` is no longer an assumed field but a CR/construction consequence. -/

/-! ## §7.E — THE SLIM CANONICAL SOURCES: the live soundness authority floor with `hfaith`/`leafAt` GONE.

`EffAuthoritySource` carries `leafAt` + `hfaith : DeployedFaithfulEff` as ASSUMED structure FIELDS — the
soundness laundering. `EffAuthoritySourceCanon` is the SLIM replacement the LIVE soundness keystones now
consume: it has NO `leafAt` (the leaf function is PINNED to the canonical `canonicalLeafAt caps` the
cap-tree actually commits) and NO `hfaith` (faithfulness is CONSTRUCTED inside `_authorizes` via
`deployedFaithfulEff_canonical`). The only NEW carry over the trace data is the named IPC-tier residual
`hipc` (a `Custom` cap rides the `vkOfTag` residual) + the bit bound `hn32`. The opened-leaf
identification `hedge` is now "the prover opens the CANONICAL leaf" — the realizable honest-prover
identification, not a free leaf assignment.

THIS retires `hfaith`/`leafAt` from the live authority leg: the keystones (`transfer_descriptorRefines_facet`,
`stepAuthorityFacetEff`, the whole-turn fold) take `EffAuthoritySourceCanon`/`TransferAuthoritySourceCanon`,
and the deployed gate is FORCED with faithfulness a CR/construction consequence, carried no more. The
general `EffAuthoritySource` (with `leafAt`/`hfaith`) survives ONLY as the COMPLETENESS dual's home, where
`hfaith` is itself CONSTRUCTED (`CircuitCompletenessAuthorityConstruct.authConstructs_source`) — never an
assumed soundness field. -/

The whole-turn lift, ALSO at the faithful arm. We re-state the §8 `TurnDecodeChain` fold of
`CircuitSoundness` with the per-effect family carried at `dispatchArmFacet`: a verified turn (every
step's circuit `Satisfied2`, decoded, seams agreeing) whose steps refine to the FAITHFUL
`dispatchArmFacet` yields a genuine `execFullTurnA start acts = some fin`. The fold itself
(`turnDecodeChain_refines_turnSpec`) is generic over the arm's `dispatchArm`, so the faithful arm
plugs in once each step's `dispatchArmFacet ⟹ dispatchArm` (a faithful transfer IS a `.balanceA`
action whose `fullActionStep` holds — `dispatchArmFacet_to_dispatchArm`). -/

/-- **`dispatchArmFacet_to_dispatchArm` — a FAITHFUL transfer step IS a dispatcher step.** A
`dispatchArmFacet` (the faithful transfer arm: `BalanceMovementSpecFacet`, authority via
`authorizedFacetB`) entails the generic `dispatchArm` (`∃ fa, actionTag fa = e ∧ fullActionStep pre fa
post`) via the toy `.balanceA` action — PROVIDED the toy authority also holds at the step (the value
legs are shared; the executor `fullActionStep` reads the toy `authorizedB`). The faithful authority is
the STRONGER fact; this lowering is to the toy executor arm the apex's `execFullTurnA` runs. The toy
authority side-condition is the NAMED residual of the lowering (the executor still gates on
`authorizedB`; cutting it over to `authorizedFacetB` is FacetAuthority §10(A), not this module). -/

transfer (actor owns `src` ⇒ `authorizedFacetB` admits intra-vat) with a valid debit/credit, SOME
post-state meets `BalanceMovementSpecFacet` — the faithful spec is not vacuously unsatisfiable. -/
