# Dregg2.Circuit.CircuitCompletenessAuthorityConstruct — the AUTHORITY-leg DE-LAUNDERING:
CONSTRUCT the faithful cap-membership from `AuthorizedByCap`, rather than ASSUMING it.

## The laundering this closes

`CircuitCompletenessAuthority.CapOpenWitness` carried, as ASSUMED FIELDS, the WHOLE conclusion of the
cap-authority completeness rung: `hfaith : DeployedFaithfulEff …` (the leaf set is faithful at the
cap-open root), `leafAt`/`hedge`/`hsrc`/`htier` (the opened leaf IS the authorizing edge, decoding to
the genuine tier). Nothing was CONSTRUCTED from the authorizing cap — so the rung
(`authorityComplete_generic`) was the soundness keystone `effAuthoritySource_authorizes` re-run over
data that BEGGED THE QUESTION. There was no theorem `AuthorizedByCap ⟹ ∃ faithful membership`.

This module proves exactly that converse, CONSTRUCTIVELY. It is the genuine DUAL of the soundness
cap-membership bridge `DeployedCapTree.deployedCapOpen_implies_authorizedEffB`
(`MembersAt ∧ confersLeaf ⟹ ∃ cap`): we INVERT it — from `∃ cap` (`AuthorizedByCap`) we EXHIBIT the
leaf assignment, the cap-tree root, the membership opening, the conferral, and the deployed
faithfulness `DeployedFaithfulEff`.

## What is CONSTRUCTED (everything the kernel transition determines)

  * `authLeafAt c effectBit` (§1) — the faithful leaf assignment for an authorizing cap `c`: the
    `(actor ⇒ src)` edge carries a leaf decoding to `c`'s facet/tier; every OTHER edge carries a
    deny-all (`mask = 0`) leaf, so `confersLeaf` is FALSE off-edge and faithfulness is VACUOUS there.
    The genuine dual of the soundness demo `oneEdgeLeaf`, but parametric in the actual cap.
  * `authConstructedRoot S c effectBit` (§1) — the cap-tree root: the leaf digest itself (the depth-0
    opening), so `MembersAt` holds with the EMPTY path (`recomposeUp _ [] = cur`).
  * `authLeaf_membersAt` (§2) — the membership opening is CONSTRUCTED (empty path).
  * `authLeaf_confers` (§2) — the on-edge leaf CONFERS `effectBit` on BOTH axes, the facts read off
    the constructed leaf and DERIVED from the cap (`isEffectPermitted`/`isSatisfiedBy`).
  * `authConstructed_faithful` (§3) — `DeployedFaithfulEff` for the constructed assignment: every
    conferring edge is the authorizing edge, backed by the cap `c`. CONSTRUCTED, not assumed.

## What remains carried (the irreducible realizability — the StarkComplete dual)

The ONLY residual the reduced witness still carries is the cap-open TRACE realizability: a concrete
`VmTrace t` and `hsat : Satisfied2 … (effCapOpenV3 …) … t` (plus its chip-table soundness and the row
identification tying the trace's committed `cap_root`/`src` columns to the constructed root/edge). This
is the honest prover's actual in-circuit cap-tree opening — the dual of the soundness `StarkSound`
extraction, the same realizability `StarkComplete` bridges to FRI. It is NOT the conclusion: the
faithfulness, the leaf, the edge, the tier decode, and the membership are all now CONSTRUCTED here and
no longer assumed. (The slimmed carrier is `CapOpenTraceFloor`, §4 below.)

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}. No `Satisfied2`/`DeployedFaithfulEff` is
ASSUMED here — they are CONSTRUCTED/PROVED. NEW file; imports read-only.

`vkOfTier` / `tierOfTag_tierByte` — the total tier round-trip (the deployed `auth_tag` BYTE → `AuthTier`
is the inverse of `AuthTier.tierByte` under the matching `vkOfTier`, on ALL tiers incl. `Custom`) — are
now the SHARED canonical-leaf machinery in `Dregg2.Circuit.DeployedCapTree.CapHashScheme` (the soundness
home), imported above. Both this completeness construction's `authLeafAt` decode and the soundness
`canonicalLeaf` decode read off the SAME inverse — no duplicate. We use it to make the CONSTRUCTED leaf's
decoded tier EQUAL the authorizing cap's tier, so the cap's `isSatisfiedBy` transfers verbatim. -/

/-! ## §1 — the CONSTRUCTED faithful leaf assignment + root (from the authorizing cap). -/

/-- **`authLeafAt c effectBit`** — the CONSTRUCTED faithful leaf assignment for an authorizing cap `c`
at the edge `(actor ⇒ c.target)` performing `effectBit`. The matching edge `(actor, c.target)` carries
a leaf decoding to: facet `mask_lo := effectBit` (so the decoded facet permits `effectBit`), tier
`auth_tag := c.tier.tierByte` (so the decoded tier — under `vkOfTier c.tier` — is exactly `c.tier`),
`target := c.target`. EVERY OTHER edge carries a deny-all (`mask = 0`) leaf, where `isEffectPermitted`
is FALSE, so `confersLeaf` is false and the faithfulness obligation is vacuous off-edge. The parametric
dual of the soundness demo `oneEdgeLeaf`. -/

/-- **`authConstructedRoot S c effectBit`** — the CONSTRUCTED cap-tree root for the authorizing edge:
the leaf digest of the on-edge leaf itself (the depth-0 opening). The honest prover's full depth-16

digest IS the constructed root, so the depth-0 opening (`path := []`) witnesses `MembersAt`. (The honest

DECODED facet/tier confer `effectBit` under `provided`: the facet is `maskOfLimbs effectBit 0 =
effectBit` (permits, since the cap permits the same bit on its own facet... but read off the leaf), and
the tier decodes to exactly `c.tier` (round-trip, §0), which `provided` satisfies. NOTE the leaf's facet
is the SINGLETON `effectBit` mask, so `isEffectPermitted (some effectBit) effectBit` is the genuine
submask test `effectBit &&& effectBit ≠ 0`, requiring `effectBit ≠ 0` (true for `1 <<< n`). -/

/-- **`authConstructed_faithful` — `DeployedFaithfulEff` is CONSTRUCTED.** The constructed leaf
assignment FAITHFULLY realizes `caps`: every conferring member edge must be the authorizing edge
`(actor0, c.target)` (every other edge is deny-all, where `confersLeaf` is FALSE), and there the
backing cap is exactly the authorizing `c ∈ caps actor0`. This is the genuine INVERSE of the soundness
`DeployedFaithfulEff.backed` — there the cap is EXTRACTED from a faithful opening; here it is the one
the authorizing hypothesis HANDS us, and the faithfulness is BUILT around it.

It is keyed on the witnessing cap `c` for `caps actor0` (the `AuthorizedByCap` data); off-edge
conferral is impossible so backedness is vacuous, and on the authorizing edge `c` itself is the
witness. -/

`authConstructed_faithful` + `authLeaf_membersAt` + `authLeaf_confers` mean that from `AuthorizedByCap`,
the faithfulness / membership / leaf / edge / tier are ALL constructed. The ONLY residual a completeness
witness still needs is the cap-open TRACE (`t`, `hsat`, `hChip`) plus the row-identification tying the
trace's committed `cap_root`/`src` columns to the constructed root/edge. We package that residual as
`CapOpenTraceFloor`, ASSEMBLE the soundness carrier `EffAuthoritySource` from it + the constructed
faithfulness, and FORCE the deployed gate — the rung the laundering pretended to discharge. -/
