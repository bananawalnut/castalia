# `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.MinaBodyPreimageBitsAir` — **THE 2 381 CHUNK BITS STOP BEING FREE.**

⚑ SUBSTRATE, SAID OUT LOUD (House Law #1): this is a **Lean-authored AIR**. `bodyBitsDesc` is
`EffectLower.lowerTiedAir` applied to the `EffectAir` source `bodyBitsAir` (§3). There is **no
hand-written `VmConstraint2` in this file** and Rust authors nothing; Rust proves the artifact.

## ⚑⚑ THE HOLE THIS CLOSES

`MinaStateBodyHashChain` §8 residual 2, in its own words:

> *"**`pack_to_fields` IS NOT IN CIRCUIT.** … nothing gates that they are the packing of 819
> width-declared chunks, and in particular **nothing forces each chunk `< 2^n`**, without which the
> packing is not injective. That is the next rung and it is cheap: 781 of the 819 chunks are ONE
> BIT."*

`Bridge.MinaPackInjective` proves the arithmetic half — `packing_is_injective`, and
`the_range_hypothesis_is_load_bearing` exhibits the alias that follows when the hypothesis is
dropped:

    packToFields ⟨[], [(1, 1), (0, 1)]⟩ = [2] = packToFields ⟨[], [(0, 1), (2, 1)]⟩

Same 49 absorbed elements, same `state_body_hash`, same 25-link chain, same root — **and every link
honest.** This file is the gate that discharges the hypothesis.

## ⚑ THE SHAPE, AND WHY IT IS BITS AND NOT CHUNKS

The brief for this rung read *"booleanity for the 781, declared-width for the rest"*. Re-derived on
the deployed field: **a declared width IS a bit count, and at BabyBear a 32- or 64-bit chunk has no
column to live in** (`p ≈ 2^31`). So every chunk is carried as its own bit slice and the 38 wide
chunks are gated by the SAME `x·(x−1) = 0` the 781 booleans are. `MinaPackInjective.bitsToNat_lt` is
that identification as a theorem: `n` boolean columns cannot denote a value `≥ 2^n`, whatever the
prover writes.

⚑ **AND THE PRICE MOVED THE OTHER WAY FROM THE BRIEF.** The brief warned *"your chunk gates ADD
range lookups; price them in committed width"* — because `MainLayout::build` appends a nibble aux
block per range lookup and range decomposition was 71.7% of the unnarrowed accumulator row. **This
descriptor declares NO table and emits NO lookup.** A booleanity gate is a degree-2 window gate, not
a bus query, so the committed width is the declared width: **2 683 declared, 2 683 committed, 1.00×**
(`the_committed_width_is_the_declared_width`, and `circuit/tests/mina_body_preimage_bits_proves.rs`
re-derives it from `decomp_cols_pub` on the emitted bytes). Against `dregg-pasta-fp-chainlink::v1`'s
469 → 1 037 (2.21×) and the accumulator's 3 048 → 10 756 (3.53×), the chunk gates are the first rung
in this cone whose aux block is empty.

## Layout — ONE ROW, and the row is the whole packed preimage

    col 0 .. 2380         BIT j      the j-th bit of the packed half of `Body.to_input`,
                                     chunks in append order, MSB-first WITHIN each chunk
    col 2381 .. 2682      PLIMB e k  limb k of packed field element 38+e, base 256, k = 0 lowest
                                     (e < 11, k < ⌈W_e/8⌉ — 32,29,29,29,32,29,28,32,28,25,9)

    PI 0 .. 301           PLIMB e k, published so a recursion fold can reach it from
                          `air_public_targets` — the layout `MinaStateBodyHashChain`'s absorbed
                          block already speaks (`SK = 32` eight-bit limbs an element)

⚑ **WHY THE BIT COLUMNS ARE 2 381 AND NOT 11 × 254.** A packed element is `⌈W_e/8⌉` bytes wide and
the eleven runs have DIFFERENT widths (254, 226, 229, 229, 254, 227, 224, 254, 223, 194, 67). Giving
every element a uniform 254 bit columns would leave `254 − W_e` columns that the honest witness sets
to zero and nothing refuses — a PHANTOM CHUNK, and an element that is the packing of no in-range
stream at all. The bit columns are exactly the stream's, so the phantom is unrepresentable rather
than gated.

⚑ **THE SCHEDULE IS DESCRIPTOR SHAPE, NOT WITNESS — AND THAT IS LOAD-BEARING.**
`MinaPackInjective.the_schedule_hypothesis_is_load_bearing` exhibits `[(1,1)]` and `[(1,2)]`: both in
range, both packing to `[1]`. A prover who may DECLARE the widths chooses the reading. Here the
widths are the slice lengths of a constant partition
(`the_run_schedule_is_the_real_blocks_packing`), and `MinaStateHashPackPrice.
the_packing_control_flow_reads_only_the_width` is why that is legitimate: `packStep`'s branch is a
function of `(n, accN)` and never of a value, so the chunk boundaries of a `Protocol_state.Body` are
fixed by its TYPE and are the same for every Mina block.

## ⚑ WHAT THIS BUYS, IN THE UNITS THE CAMPAIGN USES — AND WHAT IT DOES NOT

**Of the `state_body_hash` preimage — 38 whole field elements and 819 width-declared chunks — this
rung constrains ALL FORTY-NINE ABSORBED ELEMENTS SINCE 2026-08-09**: the 819 chunks by booleanity,
and the 38 whole field elements by the felt-level `.limbs` gate.

  * ⚑ **CONSTRAINED: 2 381 bits.** Every chunk is a bit slice of a boolean vector, so every chunk is
    below its declared width (`MinaPackInjective.the_boolean_gates_force_the_range`), so
    `packing_is_injective` applies and the eleven packed elements determine all 819 chunk values
    exactly once (`MinaPackInjective.the_gated_bits_are_determined_by_the_packing`).
  * ⚑⚑ **CONSTRAINED SINCE 2026-08-09: the 38 whole field elements.** They pass through
    `packToFields` untouched and have no declared width — so the gate that fits them is not a chunk
    gate but the FELT-level one, `AirLeg.limbs`, the same construct `minaLcVerifyDesc` spends
    eighteen range lookups on for its two state hashes. Each element gets `SK = 32` base-256 limb
    columns and ONE `.limbs` leg at `bits := 8` (`fieldLimbsLeg`), so a row this descriptor accepts
    denotes 38 values BELOW `2^256` — which is exactly `Seam.Renders`' canonicality hypothesis and
    therefore exactly what an elementwise 32-limb weld needs to carry a whole value with no digest
    (`Seam.limb_inj`). ⚠ Say the price out loud: **1 216 range lookups where this descriptor
    previously had zero**, and the committed width stops being the declared width
    (`the_field_gates_are_the_whole_lookup_bill`).
  * ⚑⚑ **AND THE WELD EXISTS SINCE 2026-08-09.** `MinaBodyPreimageSeams.bodyPreimageSeam j` is the
    25-seam family that connects this descriptor's 1 518 published limb slots to
    `MinaStateBodyHashChain`'s twenty-five links' ABSORBED blocks, elementwise, with the
    `32 − ⌈W_e/8⌉` high limbs of each packed element and all 32 limbs of the odd-tail pad zero-pinned
    on the chain side. S1 names the published slots on both ends; S2 (`bodyPreimageSeamCertifies`)
    is refutable (`body_preimage_seam_S2_needs_the_seam`). What was an executor comparison is a
    seam-forced conjunct.

## ⚑ WHAT THIS BREAKS (flag day, stated so it is findable)

**2026-08-08 — A NEW DESCRIPTOR, `dregg-mina-body-preimage-bits::v1`.** Nothing existing changes
shape. It emits `circuit/descriptors/by-name/dregg-mina-body-preimage-bits-v1.json` and MINTS a VK
for it; no VK rotates, nothing re-genesises, and `PROVENANCE.json` gains no row that this file
stamps — the stamp is the operator's ceremony and four rows already await it.

⚑ **2026-08-09 — THAT DESCRIPTOR CHANGES SHAPE, AND EVERY BYTE OF IT MOVES.** `trace_width`
**2 683 → 3 899**, `piCount` **302 → 1 518**, `tables` `[] → [range_w8]`, constraints
**2 985 → 4 239**. The PI vector is now the ABSORB ORDER of `packToFields` — slots `[0, 1216)` are
the 38 whole field elements' 32 limbs each and slots `[1216, 1518)` are the eleven packed elements'
`⌈W_e/8⌉` — so `PI_PLIMB e k` MOVED by `+1216` and any consumer reading the old base reads field
element 38's limbs. RE-EMITS: `circuit/descriptors/by-name/dregg-mina-body-preimage-bits-v1.json`,
its VK, and `circuit/tests/mina_body_preimage_bits_proves.rs`' width/pi/constraint pins. The old
shape REFUSES to load: a 302-slot claim cannot satisfy `pinsFit 1518`, and the seam reader
(`seam.rs::SeamEnd::require_matches`) RECOMPUTES the fingerprint lanes and refuses the stale
descriptor by name-and-lanes rather than accepting it silently.

/-- ⚑ **HOW MANY LIMBS EACH ELEMENT GETS — `⌈W_e/8⌉`, AND NOT A UNIFORM 32.**

⚠ This is not a saving, it is a REFUSAL. A uniform 32-limb block would give element 10 (67 bits)
twenty-three limbs whose gate is `PLIMB = 0` — a published column no gate joins to any other, i.e.
**twenty-three decorative anchors**, fifty across the eleven elements. `LightClientAnchorConnectivity`
measures exactly that and `scripts/check-descriptor-anchor-inertness.py` is the ratchet. Allocating
`⌈W_e/8⌉` makes the empty limb unrepresentable instead of published-and-inert.

⚠ **AND SAY WHAT THAT LEAVES OWED**, because it moves an obligation rather than removing one: the
chain's absorbed block is `SK = 32` limbs an element, so the weld must connect these `⌈W_e/8⌉` and
pin the remaining `32 − ⌈W_e/8⌉` chain-side limbs to ZERO. `the_high_limbs_of_the_real_elements_are_

/-! ## §6 — ⚑⚑⚑ THE CONCLUSION, IN THE UNITS THE CAMPAIGN USES. -/

/-- ⚑⚑⚑ **WHAT THE GATE BUYS: THE 819 CHUNKS ARE DETERMINED BY THE ELEVEN PACKED ELEMENTS.**
`MinaPackInjective.the_gated_bits_are_determined_by_the_packing` at THIS block's slicing: two rows
this descriptor accepts, sliced by the SAME schedule, whose packings agree, denote the same 819
chunk values. So the eleven packed field elements the body-hash chain absorbs pin all 2 381 bits.

⚠ **AND THE 38 FIELD ELEMENTS ARE NOT IN THIS STATEMENT, DELIBERATELY.** `fields` is a parameter
that rides through untouched on both sides, because injectivity of the PACKING is a statement about
the chunk half alone. What binds the field half is a different object and a different kind of
statement: the felt gate (`the_field_gate_bounds_every_whole_element_limb`) plus the weld
(`MinaBodyPreimageSeams`), not `packing_is_injective`. Conflating the two is how "the packing is
injective" would come to sound like "the preimage is determined". -/

/-! ## §7 — ⚠ RESIDUALS, NAMED — AND TWO OF THE FOUR CLOSED ON 2026-08-09.

1. ✅ **THE WELD IS HERE.** `MinaBodyPreimageSeams.bodyPreimageSeam j` connects these 1 518 slots to
   the twenty-five links' absorbed blocks, elementwise, with the high limbs zero-pinned; S2 is a
   named theorem and `body_preimage_seam_S2_needs_the_seam` proves the seam-dropped form FALSE.
   ⚠ It is a `SeamSpec` a fold READS (`seam.rs::apply_seam`), so it is recursion wiring with a
   theorem attached — not an in-descriptor constraint, and it inherits the FRI floor like every
   other seam in this cone.
2. ✅ **THE 38 WHOLE FIELD ELEMENTS.** Gated, `fieldLimbsLeg`, 1 216 range lookups.
3. ⚠ **NOTHING SAYS A BODY IS REAL.** That is `PICKLES_OPENING_WITNESSED`, unchanged — and it is
   now the ONLY thing between "a 49-element stream this descriptor gates and that chain absorbs"
   and "a `Protocol_state.Body`". ⚑ **What a prover still chooses is stated in §7a.**
4. ⚠ **THE RECURSION BOUNDARY.** That a verifying STARK implies its statement is the FRI obligation
   this whole stack carries. This rung stands at exactly that resolution.

## §7a — ⚑⚑⚑ WHAT A PROVER STILL CHOOSES, IN THE ONLY HONEST FORM: THE CHOICE MOVED TWICE AND HAS
NOT DISAPPEARED.

  * 2026-08-07 moved it from **`BODYHASH` — one felt** to **its 49-element preimage.**
  * 2026-08-08 moved it from "any 49 elements" to "any 49 elements whose last eleven are the packing
    of 819 chunks of the declared widths" — the chunk half.
  * 2026-08-09 (this rung) removes the freedom to make the published limbs *disagree with the
    chain's absorbed stream*, and bounds the whole-field half to `2^256`.

⚠ **WHAT REMAINS IS NOT SMALL AND IS NOT AN ENCODING QUESTION.** A prover still chooses **the 2 381
bits and the 38 field elements themselves** — i.e. the whole `Protocol_state.Body` — subject only to
its SHAPE (819 chunks at the type's fixed widths, 38 canonical felts) and to the requirement that
the same body run through the chain. Nothing here says the epoch ledger hash is an epoch ledger
hash, that the VRF output verifies, or that the global slot is consistent. **Every one of the 857
pieces is a consensus-rule obligation of the Mina daemon, and this circuit constrains their SHAPE
and their AGREEMENT, not their CONTENT.** The one object that would speak to content is
`PICKLES_OPENING_WITNESSED`, which is a witness carrier, not a check.
