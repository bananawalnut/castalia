# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.ShieldedSpendDescriptor — the Lean-authored shielded-spend descriptor
# with the membership root PINNED to the committed accumulator (seam #15, in-AIR).

**This is Lean-authored AIR.** This module authors the algebra; Rust parses the emitted IR2
bytes and supplies witnesses — it constructs no constraints. FIRST build lane of the
ember-approved shielded Option-A redesign (`docs/DECISION-shielded-redesign-2026-07-20.md`,
`docs/PLAN-shielded-apex-redesign-2026-07-20.md` §5): the deployed shielded-spend AIR
(retired `spend_circuit.rs`, former line 192 — `shielded_spend_descriptor()`, C1–C7b as
Rust `ConstraintExpr` data) is house-law-#1 DEBT, and its `merkle_root` PI is prover-supplied,
pinned to nothing (seam **#15** = spend a note that was never created — theft/inflation).

## What this descriptor IS

The IR2 (`EffectVmDescriptor2`) re-authoring of the spend relation the Rust `spend_circuit`
proves — 4-ary Merkle membership + nullifier + note-commitment preimage + value-binding, all
Poseidon2 `hash_fact` sites (the chip tuple is the byte-twin of the Rust `fact_site_always`
encoding at `shielded_ring_clearing_nleg_air.rs:300-324`: arity-7 absorb
`[x, f0, f1, f2, f3, 0xFACF, 1]`) — **with the security fix**:

* a fourth PI, `pi[3] = committed_root` — the committed shielded-commitment accumulator root,
  filled by the EXECUTOR from the ledger (NEVER from the wire), and at the apex `connect`ed to
  the turn's committed commitments-root exactly as the already-built
  `prove_shielded_spend_root_binding_node_segmented`
  (retired `shielded_spend_leaf_adapter.rs`, former line 594) binds claim lane 1;
* the membership chain's final fold (`parent` on the last row) is PI-pinned to `pi[3]` — the
  tree the spend opens against IS the committed accumulator;
* the `merkle_root` claim LANE (column 19, the `[nf, root, vb]` tuple slot the apex reads) is
  pinned to BOTH `pi[1]` (the claim slot, kept for `RING_LEG_CLAIM_LEN = 3` shape parity) and
  `pi[3]` — so `pi[1] ≡ pi[3]` is FORCED: there is no satisfiable assignment in which the wire
  supplies a root different from the committed accumulator root. The deployed wound — the
  verifier filling the root PI from `payload.merkle_root` — becomes UNSAT-or-unrepresentable.

Constraint map (Rust C-number → here): C2 position-validity → `posBody` gate (+ last-row
re-lowering, the deployed last-row-repair shape); C3 Merkle fold → `lkParent` (arity-7 fact
chip lookup, every row); C4 nullifier → `lkNullifier` — hashing `leaf_commit` (not the gated
`current`): row 0 has `current ≡ leaf_commit` (C6b boundary), so this binds the SAME relation
`nullifier = hash_fact(note_commitment, key[0..4])` with an EXACT ℤ-link to the recomputed
commitment, and IR2's first-row boundary gating replaces the C1 `is_leaf` selector column;
C5 chain continuity → `chainWindow`; C6a leaf-commit recompute → `lkLeafCommit`; C6b leaf
binding → first-row boundary `current − leaf_commit`; C7a value-binding recompute →
`lkValueBinding` (+ the two pad-zero gates); C7b/nullifier/root PI pins → `piBinding`s.

## What is PROVED here (the point — seam #15 in the AIR)

* **`root_is_pinned`** — field-faithful: a `Satisfied2` trace forces (i) the row-0
  `merkle_root` lane ≡ `pi[committed_root]`, (ii) the last row's `parent` — the root the
  membership chain actually folds to — ≡ `pi[committed_root]`, and (iii)
  `pi[merkle_root] ≡ pi[committed_root]`.
* **The theft-forge teeth** — `self_chosen_tree_unsat` / `chain_root_forge_unsat` /
  `wire_root_decoupled_unsat`: a trace whose membership root (lane or chain fold) differs from
  the committed-accumulator PI, or whose claim-root PI decouples from the committed-root PI,
  is UNSAT. A prover cannot open against a self-chosen tree.
* **`spend_relation_row0`** — under a sound chip table (`ChipTableSound`), a satisfying trace's
  row 0 carries the genuine spend relation: `nullifier = hash_fact(leaf_commit, key[0..4])`,
  `leaf_commit = hash_fact(value, [asset, owner, randomness])`, `value_binding =
  hash_fact(value, [asset, randomness, pad])`, `parent = hash_fact(current, [sibs, pos])`,
  `current ≡ leaf_commit`, and the nullifier/value-binding PI pins.
* **`zero_witness_satisfies`** — the constraint system is INHABITED (an explicit all-zero
  1-row witness with a genuine chip-table row), so the UNSAT teeth are not vacuous; and
  `forged_zero_trace_refused` runs a tooth on a concrete forged instance.

## What this descriptor does NOT yet close (named honestly)

* **#16 (value-link fold)** — this leaf publishes/recomputes `value_binding` exactly as the
  deployed leaf does, but the Σ-conservation fold over the legs' value cells (the
  `nleg_air.rs:384-408` conservation + range machinery) lives in the NEXT lane's
  transfer-clearing descriptor, not here.
* **#17 (Ristretto cut)** — retiring the off-AIR Ristretto conservation gate is the routing
  cutover, a later lane.
* Wiring this descriptor as an `Effect::Custom` carrier in `apply_shielded_transfer` (Rust,
  integrator), the descriptor-JSON golden regen into `circuit/descriptors/` + `PROVENANCE.json`
  row, and the apex fold that supplies `pi[3]` from the committed turn root. The VK-gate is
  RESOLVED descriptor-agnostically (a Custom carrier's own vk rides in the witness,
  version-checked by `require_custom_carrier_vk8`), so this lane is staged-additive.
* The multi-row recomposed-Merkle-path refinement walk (the `*Refine`-tier composition across
  the trace) — deferred exactly as `MerkleMembership4aryWideEmit` defers its walk.
* The post-A frontier residuals: `pedTwoGen` ≠ real Ristretto; the BabyBear `2^VALUE_BITS`
  amount cap. And this descriptor's digests are the deployed 1-felt (~31-bit) lanes — the
  felt-width widening of the SHIELDED tree is a separate campaign item, not smuggled in here.

⚑ **`hCols` is why "7-lane" is a fact and not a hope (added 2026-08-03).** `padToE 5` pads by
`5 - cols.length`, which is `Nat` subtraction and SATURATES: at `cols.length > 5` nothing is
appended and the block is `cols.length + 2` felts, not 7. The only check downstream is
`chipLookupTupleNarrow`'s `ChipArityAdmitted` on the block's length — and the admitted set
`[0, 2, 3, 4, 7, 11, 16]` has HOLES a saturated pad lands in: `cols.length = 9` gives 11 and
`= 14` gives 16, both ADMITTED. So the post-pad check bites at 6/7/8 and MISSES at 9 and 14,
emitting a "7-lane" site with `MARK` and `1` at the wrong slots. The obligation therefore rides on
the PRE-pad length, where it says what the name says. Both misses are exhibited as named
`decide` theorems in `Market.ShieldedRingEndpointDescriptor` (`factLookup_old_condition_admitted_nine`
/`_fourteen` and the refusals that replace them); every call site here passes 4 or 5 columns. -/

the RECOMPUTED commitment (C6a's output) instead of the `is_leaf`-gated `current` binds the

`current ≡ leaf_commit`, so the membership leaf is that same commitment. -/

/-- **C8: THE OWNER DERIVATION — `owner = hash_fact(key[0..4])`, every row.**

⚑ The hole this closes, measured: `cKEY0..cKEY3` occurred in `lkNullifier` and in NO other
constraint; `cOWNER` occurred in `lkLeafCommit` and in NO other constraint; **nothing related them.**
So the spending key was CARRIED, not BOUND: a prover could spend the same note under a FRESH key,
publish a DIFFERENT nullifier, satisfy the whole AIR, and meet no accumulator member. A double-spend
survived a fully repaired C4, and `emitted_nullifier_double_spend_refused` could only close REPLAY
WITH THE SAME KEY — because "same key" was a HYPOTHESIS an adversary controls.

This gate makes the owner a FUNCTION of the key (the Zcash `ivk`-shape binding). The note's leaf
commitment already binds `owner`; now `owner` binds `key`; so for a fixed note the key is fixed up to
a Poseidon2 preimage, and the nullifier is fixed with it. A fresh key no longer spends the same note
— it commits a DIFFERENT note. `hk0..hk3` stop being hypotheses and become derived
(`emitted_same_note_forces_same_key`). -/

/-- Under a SOUND chip table (`ChipTableSound hash (t.tf .poseidon2)` — the chip AIR's own
per-permutation faithfulness), a satisfying trace's row 0 carries the genuine C-shape:
the four `hash_fact` bindings hold as ℤ equations of the abstract `hash`, the membership leaf
is the recomputed note commitment, and the nullifier / value-binding PIs are pinned. -/
