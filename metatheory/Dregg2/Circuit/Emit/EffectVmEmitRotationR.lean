# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.EffectVmEmitRotationR — the rotated state block, PARAMETRIC in the
register count R (the 16-vs-24-vs-32 measurement probes).

`EffectVmEmitRotation.lean` pins the R=16 staged emission (the deployed reference; its
artifacts are byte-frozen). THIS module re-expresses that emission as a FUNCTION of the
register count R, so the register-count decision (`docs/ROTATION-CUTOVER.md` — registers are
ALWAYS-PAID limbs in every turn proof's commitment chain, heap fields are METERED umem rows)
can be settled by MEASUREMENT instead of vibes:

  * **§1 the layout, as functions of R** — every column index of the rotated block
    (`capRootCol R = R+1`, …, `irootCol R = R+7`, `stateCommitCol R = R+8`); the R=16
    instance `#guard`-pins to the deployed constants (the pins do not move).
  * **§2 the arity-{2,4} chunking** — `chunk31` groups the post-head limbs into 3-wide
    chip absorptions (digest + 3 = arity 4) with a singleton tail (digest + 1 = arity 2);
    the deployed chip AIR pins arity ∈ {2,4}, so an arity-3 tail REFUSES — the chunking
    NEVER produces one (`#guard`ed per R). The iroot rides its own arity-2 final site,
    LITERALLY LAST, at every R (the `CommitBindsMMR` last-limb discipline).
  * **§3 `wireCommitR`** — the chained commitment over an ARBITRARY pre-iroot limb list.
    `wireCommitR_eq_pinned`: at R=16 it IS the pinned `wireCommit`, by `rfl`. The keystone
    `wireCommitR_binds` holds PARAMETRICALLY in R (equal-length limb lists, equal chained
    commits ⇒ equal lists ∧ equal iroots, under the ONE `Poseidon2SpongeCR` floor) — no
    per-R axiom, no per-R re-proof: instantiating the list length at R+7 IS the R-register
    binding theorem.
  * **§4 the probe descriptors** — `rotationProbeVmDescriptorR R` (v1 grammar) and its
    graduated IR-v2 form; the R=16 instance graduates to BYTE-IDENTICAL wire JSON as the
    pinned `rotationProbeVmDescriptor2` (`#guard` on the emitted strings — the strongest
    possible no-drift statement). R=24 and R=32 are emitted for the Rust measurement
    harness (`circuit/src/descriptor_ir2.rs` — proof bytes / prove ms / verify ms /
    opened-values bytes / chip rows, plus tamper teeth per R).
  * **§5 per-R welds** — the site walks pin `STATE_COMMIT = wireCommitR` of the row's own
    limbs (R=24/R=32), and the end-to-end keystones (`rotationProbeR{24,32}_pins_commit`,
    `…_commit_binds_published`) re-prove the pinned module's §4 story at each measured R.

## Axiom hygiene

`#assert_axioms` ⊆ {propext, Classical.choice, Quot.sound}; crypto only as the named
`Poseidon2SpongeCR` hypothesis. STAGED: nothing here rides
the live wire; the R=24/R=32 artifacts exist to be MEASURED.

/-! ## §3.8 — `wireCommitR8`: the FAITHFUL 8-FELT chained commitment (Phase B-ROTATION).

The 1-felt chain above (`chainFrom`/`wireCommitR`) threads a SINGLE ℤ accumulator — ~31-bit,
collision in seconds. The faithful commitment threads an 8-FELT carrier: each step is ONE wide
permutation `permW (acc ++ c)` exposing 8 output lanes (`acc : List ℤ`, length 8), so EVERY
intermediate carrier is 8 felts — there is NO 31-bit intermediate (the anti-laundering crux; a
1-felt-chain-with-wide-final-squeeze is the forbidden laundered version). The Rust twin is
`poseidon2::wire_commit_8` over `single_perm_compress`; the in-circuit faithfulness floor is the
wide chip lever `chip_lookup_sound_N` (the `permW`-parametric wide squeeze, CHIP_RATE = 11 ≥ the
11 inputs of a carrier‖3-limb step).

The wide floor `Poseidon2WideCR permW` is the EXACT analogue of `Poseidon2SpongeCR`: the wide
permutation is injective on its argument list (collision-resistant at full squeeze width). The
binding keystone lifts the 1-felt proof unchanged — the chain logic is the same fold, only the
carrier widened from `ℤ` to `List ℤ`. -/

digest value, but they land the EMITTED final chip lookup on the chip AIR's WIDE (arity-11) row
