# Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.EffectVmEmitUMemWeldWide — the Lean-emitted WIDE+UMEM WELDED registry
(STAGED, VK-RISK-FREE): the MISSING VERIFIER LEG's grounded descriptor set.

The WIDE+umem weld (`prove_wide_umem_welded_staged` + the IVC fold) had a producer leg and an IVC
leg but NO Lean-emitted, byte-pinned descriptor set the wire verifier could iterate — so a welded
proof verified under no DEPLOYED descriptor (only against the descriptor the producer just built,
or the leg's own carried copy). This module CLOSES that: it welds the universal-memory cohort leg
INTO every member of the verified `CapOpenEmit.v3RegistryCapOpenWide` (the 45-member 8-felt wide
registry), IN LEAN — so the welded VK is Lean-grounded (the ONE-Lean-derived-circuit/VK invariant),
NOT hand-welded in Rust. The driver `EmitWideUMemWeldRegistryProbe.lean` writes these exact bytes to
`circuit/descriptors/rotation-wide-umem-welded-registry-staged.tsv`, pinned by
`WIDE_UMEM_WELD_REGISTRY_FP` (the sha256 the Rust side asserts) + the per-member parity tooth
(Rust's `weld_umem_into_wide_descriptor` of the bare member byte-equals the Lean-emitted welded
member). The Rust verify paths (`verify_effect_vm_rotated_with_cutover`, the IVC `admit_welded_leg`)
iterate THIS registry as a NEW accepted form beside the bare wide registry.

## The weld (the Lean twin of Rust `weld_umem_into_descriptor_with_suffix(_, dom, …, cohort:=false)`)

Purely ADDITIVE: append the single-domain cohort `umemOp` over 7 fresh main columns
`[base .. base+7)` (`base` = the wide trace width, PAST the wide carriers) + the `umemory` /
`umem_boundary` tables onto the wide member. It NEVER touches `public_input_count` nor any existing
constraint, so the wide member's whole PI vector + every PI binding (incl. all 16 wide-commit
`PiBinding`s = the 8-felt ~124-bit before/after anchors) survive UNCHANGED — the no-narrowing
property the VK epoch refused to cross. The single-domain `dom` the welded member carries is the
domain that member's effect touches (heap 1 / caps 2 / nullifiers 3, per `turn/src/umem.rs`).

## VK-RISK-FREE

A NEW registry constant BESIDE the deployed wide registry: no VK bump, nothing on the live wire,
`umem_witness_enabled` untouched. The deployed default prover/verifier stay bare until the gated VK
epoch (the owner's separate go).

def wideUMemWeldSuffix : String := "-umem-wide-welded-staged"

/-- The single-domain universal-memory domain a wide member's effect touches, keyed by the LIVE
registry key. Mirrors the per-cell domain map of `turn/src/umem.rs` the cohort emitter uses: a UKey's
`domain()` decides the plane, and the `caps` plane (domain 2) is `CapSlot`/`Delegate`/`DelegationSnapshot`/
`DelegationEpoch`/`Permissions`/`VerificationKey`/`Program`/`CapTombstone`/`Factory`, the `heap` plane
(domain 1) is `Field`/`Balance`/`Nonce`/`Lifecycle`/`Identity`/… So:

  * the capability verbs (grant / attenuate / revoke / introduce / delegate / refresh / spawn, with
    their CapOpen / Write twins) touch the `caps` plane via `CapSlot`/`Delegate`/`Program`;
  * **`setPerms` / `setVK` ALSO touch the `caps` plane** — their projection diff is a single
    `UKey::Permissions` / `UKey::VerificationKey` write, both `UDomain::Caps` (`turn/src/umem.rs`
    `UKey::domain`). The producer's welded leg therefore reconciles domain 2; a welded entry declaring
    `heap` here binds NO descriptor on the deployed wire (the 9th flip-refusal `a5df2470`). They are
    NOT name-prefixed by a cap verb, so they are matched explicitly;
  * every OTHER cohort member's single-domain state touch is a `heap`-domain write (e.g. cellSeal /
    cellUnseal / cellDestroy / receiptArchive move `Lifecycle`; transfer / burn / mint move `Balance`).

The multi-domain note/bridge verbs are NOT single-domain-weldable (the producer fails closed on them),
so their welded entry is unexercisable — keyed `heap` as a harmless placeholder. -/

/-- **The purely-ADDITIVE WIDE+umem weld.** The Lean twin of Rust
`weld_umem_into_descriptor_with_suffix(d, dom, WIDE_UMEM_WELD_SUFFIX, cohort := false)`: append the
single-domain cohort `umemOp` over 7 fresh main columns `[base .. base+7)` (`base = d.traceWidth`,
PAST the wide carriers) + the `umemory` (arity 8) / `umem_boundary` (arity 7, GENERAL — the wide
single-domain weld uses the general boundary, `cohort = false`) tables. The MAIN table arity is
bumped to the welded width; every OTHER table + EVERY existing constraint (incl. all 16 wide-commit
`PiBinding`s) survives untouched, and `piCount` is UNCHANGED — so the 8-felt anchors ride through at
the SAME PI offsets. NO narrowing. -/

deployed wire, plus the `spawnCapOpen` / `exerciseCapOpen` read legs) welded with the CAPS domain,
MINUS `grantCapWriteCapOpen` (reconciled out, exactly as `EmitWideRegistryProbe` does — it is not a
bare `WIDE_REGISTRY_STAGED_TSV` member). These are the welded twins the wire verifier resolves for the
write-routed cap siblings (delegate/grantCap, introduce, refreshDelegation, revokeCapability,
revokeDelegation): without them a write-routed welded proof verified under NO cohort descriptor. -/

/-- **The 3 LIVE-ONLY wide members the bare wide registry carries beyond `v3RegistryCapOpenWide` + the
write tail.** `WIDE_REGISTRY_STAGED_TSV` is a 57-member cover of the live V3 registry: the 45
`v3RegistryCapOpenWide` crown + the 9 §10 write-tail wrappers + THESE three —
`transferCapOpenTBVmDescriptor2R24` (the turn-identity-pinned transfer cap-open),
`heapWriteVmDescriptor2R24` (the Class-A sorted-Merkle splice), `supplyMintVmDescriptor2R24` (the
dedicated `sel.MINT` mint). They have NO `v3RegistryCapOpenWide` / `…WriteWide` emit source, so the
welded twin set omitted them — yet each is a deployed wide member a turn routes to, so a welded proof
routed to one bound NO cohort descriptor on the wire. Built at the SAME wide geometry
`EmitWideRegistryProbe` emits them (the byte-identical wide host = the bare wide member), so the Rust
`weld_umem_into_wide_descriptor` of the bare member byte-matches the welded twin. -/

touches (`wideKeyUMemDomain` returns `heap` for all three — transfer / heap-splice / mint move
`Balance` / `Lifecycle`, NOT the caps plane). These complete the welded twin set to a member-for-member
57/57 cover of the bare wide registry: with them, a welded proof routed to ANY deployed wide member
resolves a Lean-grounded welded descriptor. -/

write wrappers the deployed wire routes the write-bearing cap siblings to — PLUS the 3 live-only wide
members (`weldedLiveOnlyTail`) the bare wide registry carries beyond those two sets, completing the
57/57 cover. Keyed by the SAME live registry key (name-stable, so the by-name executor verifier
resolves the welded member as `<live key>`). The driver writes these exact bytes to the staged TSV. -/
