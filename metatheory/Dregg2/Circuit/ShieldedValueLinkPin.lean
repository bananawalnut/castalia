# Dregg2.Circuit.ShieldedValueLinkPin — the spent-leaf VALUE is never tied to the amount
  conservation clears (WOUND #16, the shielded-pool INFLATION vector).

**What this proves, and why it was missing.** The deployed shielded transfer
(`turn/src/executor/apply.rs :: apply_shielded_transfer`) accepts on two value gates that never meet:

  * **the STARK/wide side** — `verify_stark_with_wide_bindings(&transfer, &wide_bindings)`
    (`apply.rs:1753`) proves each input's membership + nullifier AND ties the published one-felt
    `value_binding` (spend circuit C7, `hash_fact(value,[asset,rand,0])`) to a full-`u64` wide carrier
    (`circuit-prove/src/shielded/wide_value_binding.rs`). Both digests are honest images of the
    STARK-witnessed **leaf value** (`spend_circuit.rs` C6+C7a). So far so good — the leaf value is bound.
  * **the Pedersen side** — `verify_full_conservation_bytes(input_legs, output_legs, …)`
    (`apply.rs:1764`, `cell-crypto/src/value_commitment.rs:490`) checks `Σ C_in = Σ C_out` in the group
    plus one `[0,2^64)` range proof per output. But it sums the **prover-supplied Pedersen legs**
    (`transfer.input_commitment_bytes()`, `transfer.rs:247`), opaque `commit(legValue, blinding)` blobs.
  * **nowhere** is the Pedersen leg's committed value tied to the STARK leaf value. `transfer.rs:196`
    says it in one line: *"This transcript binding does not prove leaf↔leg value equality."* And
    `transfer.rs:64-68`: the `value_binding` *"does not yet tie the deployed Pedersen leg to the
    STARK-witnessed leaf: `verify_value_link` exercises that compatibility bridge in tests only."*

So a malicious prover spends a note they genuinely own worth `v = 1`, honestly proving membership,
nullifier, `value_binding = Bind 1`, and the wide carrier of `1` — then supplies an input Pedersen leg
`commit(1_000_000, blinding)`. Conservation `Σ C_in = Σ C_out` balances the **fake** million against a
million of outputs (whose range proofs pass — a million is a perfectly good `[0,2^64)` value), and the
pool **mints 1_000_000 from a 1-token note.** No forged leaf (that is #15) — the spent note is real;
the theft is purely the missing leaf↔leg value link. As the decision brief puts it
(`docs/DECISION-shielded-redesign-2026-07-20.md` #16): *"Deployed conservation proves only that the
Ristretto legs balance, not that they equal the STARK-witnessed leaf values → a prover can mint by
decoupling them."*

**The LAUNDER, exposed.** Two things make the deployed path *look* closed:
  * the C7 `value_binding` IS honestly bound to the leaf value in-AIR, and the wide carrier is a
    mandatory full-`u64` binding — a reader concludes "value is bound." It is — but conservation never
    consults `value_binding`; it sums the *separate, free* Pedersen leg. A binding on a quantity the
    no-mint gate does not use buys nothing.
  * the Rust test `leaf_leg_value_link_matches_verifies_mismatch_rejects`
    (retired `shielded_transfer_m2a.rs`, former line 441) exercises `verify_value_link`, which DOES tie
    leg↔leaf (`commit(value,blinding) == leg` AND `value_link_binding(value) == value_binding`), and it
    even asserts the inflated leg is `LegMismatch`-rejected. Real — but `verify_value_link` is
    **never called by `apply_shielded_transfer`**. The test is a green light on a check the deployed
    gate does not run.

**What is proved here** (theorems over ALL inputs; the model is faithful to the two-gate structure,
HASH-AGNOSTIC — the C7/wide binding hashes `Bind`/`Wide` are abstract deterministic functions, so the
statements hold for the real Poseidon2):

  * **THE FALSIFIER (`genuine_note_mints_anything`, `genuine_note_inflates`).** The deployed accept —
    conservation over the leg values, with membership + the honest C7/wide bindings on the leaf, and NO
    `legValue = leafValue` conjunct — admits, for a genuinely committed note of ANY value `v`, a
    transfer that mints ANY amount `M` (`genuine_note_mints_anything`); concretely a `v`-note that mints
    `v+1` while the C7 binding stays honestly bound to `v` and the value-link check fails
    (`genuine_note_inflates`).
  * **THE LAUNDER, exposed (`verify_value_link_forces_link` vs `link_test_is_not_the_gate`).** The
    value-link predicate faithfully captures `verify_value_link` (with `Bind` injective, its two checks
    force `legValue = leafValue`), and the test rejecting a mismatch is real — yet the deployed accept
    (which omits it) STILL admits the inflating transfer.
  * **THE FIX, sound (`linked_conservation_over_real_value`, `linked_no_inflation`,
    `link_closes_the_falsifier`).** Adding the conjunct `∀ input, legValue = leafValue` (exactly
    `verify_value_link`'s leg tie, folded into acceptance) forces conservation to run over the REAL
    spent values, so the minted total EQUALS the real spent value — the inflation is rejected, over all
    inputs.

**Byte-safe / posture.** This module does NOT touch deployed code. The in-AIR fix — recomputing
`value_binding`/`leaf_commit` over shared value cells and enforcing `Σ value = Σ out` in-circuit — is
authored as Lean AIR in `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.ShieldedValueLinkDescriptor` (Option-A lane 2), and
*routing the deployed transfer through it* (retiring the split `verify_full_conservation_bytes` over
free Pedersen legs) is the gated deploy, NOT this file. This is the machine-checked statement of the
invariant that redesign must establish: the falsifier that prices the open wound and the soundness the
link buys.

**Scope (honest).** This is the value-link brick of the `spend_circuit → Lean` campaign, at the
resolution of the leaf↔leg value-conservation trust boundary (NOT the full AIR). Membership/nullifier
soundness (#15's root-pin is its own module), the Ristretto DLog floor and its PQ replacement (#17),
the negative-output range-proof gate (present, orthogonal), and folding `verify_value_link` into the
deployed AIR are the rest of the campaign. Modeled faithfully, they are ORTHOGONAL to this gap: the
theft here uses a genuine note and positive, in-range output values.

/-! ## 1. Felt, an input, and a transfer.

Faithful to the deployed two-gate object. One field element per lane (the BabyBear range prices offline
grind but is irrelevant to the leaf↔leg gap, so a lane is an integer, as in `ShieldedMerkleRootPin` /
`FinalityCertWidth`). Each input carries the value the STARK leaf witnesses (`leafValue`, C6-bound), the
value the Pedersen leg conservation actually sums (`legValue`, prover-supplied and opaque), and the two
honest published bindings (`valueBinding` = C7, `wideBinding` = the full-`u64` carrier). -/

/-! ## 2. The DEPLOYED accept predicate — conservation over the leg values, leaf↔leg link ABSENT.

Faithful to `apply_shielded_transfer` at HEAD: membership holds (`Member` on each leaf — #15's domain,
which HOLDS here: the attacker spends a note they genuinely own), the C7 `value_binding` and the wide
carrier are honestly bound to `leafValue`, and conservation sums the `legValue`s. The one thing missing
is any conjunct forcing `legValue = leafValue` — that omission IS the wound. -/

/-- The deployed accept, HEAD-faithful. Every conjunct is a check the deployed path actually runs;
`legValue` is constrained ONLY through conservation, never tied to `leafValue`. -/
def accepts (Bind Wide : Felt → Felt) (Member : Felt → Prop) (t : Transfer) : Prop :=

/-! ## 3. THE FALSIFIER — a genuinely committed note mints anything.

No forged leaf (that is #15): the attacker spends a note they own (`Member v`), honestly binds it, and
supplies an input Pedersen leg committing to a DIFFERENT value. Conservation balances the fake value
against the outputs; the pool mints it. -/

/-- **`genuine_note_mints_anything` (THE FALSIFIER, unbounded).** For every honest note value `v`
(genuinely committed, `Member v`) and every target mint `M`, the deployed predicate ACCEPTS a transfer
whose real spent value is `v` but whose minted total is `M`. A single small real note mints any amount.
Hash-agnostic: the C7/wide bindings are honestly `Bind v`/`Wide v`, so acceptance holds for the real
Poseidon2 whatever it is. -/

the attacker genuinely owns (`Member v`), there is a transfer that:
  * spends only that genuine note (`realSpent = v`, every leaf `Member`),
  * is ACCEPTED by the deployed predicate,
  * mints `v + 1` (`mintedTotal > realSpent` — strict inflation),
  * keeps the C7 `value_binding` HONESTLY bound to the leaf (the launder: value IS bound, uselessly),
  * FAILS the value-link check (`¬ linkHolds`, so `verify_value_link` would reject it),
  * and is REJECTED by the linked predicate.

/-! ## 4. THE LAUNDER, exposed — the value-link check is faithful, but it is not the deployed gate.

`verify_value_link` (`cell-crypto/src/value_commitment.rs:1655`) checks, for a prover opening `openVal`:
(1) `value_link_binding(openVal) == value_binding` and (2) `commit(openVal, blinding) == leg`. With the
binding injective and `value_binding = Bind leafValue` (C7) and the leg opening to `legValue`, the two
checks pin `openVal = leafValue` and `openVal = legValue`, hence `legValue = leafValue`. So `linkHolds`
IS the check. The Rust test runs it and rejects the mismatch — yet `apply` never calls it. -/

/-- **`verify_value_link_forces_link` (the check IS the link).** `verify_value_link`'s two equations,
under an injective binding, force the leaf↔leg equality that `linkHolds` states — so `linkHolds` is a
faithful model of the deployed-absent check, not an invented predicate. -/

/-- **`link_test_is_not_the_gate` (the LAUNDER, exposed).** The value-link check (which the test
exercises and passes) rejecting a mismatch does NOT close the theft: the deployed predicate `accepts`
STILL admits an inflating transfer that `linkHolds` rejects. The test and the gate are different teeth;
only the link (folded into acceptance) bites the mint. -/

The single missing conjunct closes it: conservation over the REAL spent values (`acceptsLinked`, §2). -/

/-- **`linked_conservation_over_real_value` (the fix, PURE).** Under the link, the leg total equals the
