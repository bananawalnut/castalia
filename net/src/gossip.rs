//! GossipNetwork: Plumtree-inspired lazy-push gossip for dregg.
//!
//! Implements a hybrid eager/lazy push protocol over QUIC unidirectional streams:
//!
//! - **Eager push**: Full messages are forwarded immediately to a small subset of peers
//!   (the "eager set"), forming a spanning tree for fast delivery.
//! - **Lazy push**: IHave notifications (message hash only) are sent to remaining peers.
//!   If a peer receives an IHave for a message it hasn't seen, it sends a Graft request.
//! - **Prune**: If a peer receives a full message from a non-eager source (i.e., it was
//!   already delivered by a faster eager link), it sends Prune to demote the slow link.
//! - **Anti-entropy**: Periodic hash digest exchange (capped at a configurable maximum)
//!   catches any messages missed by the eager/lazy protocol without bandwidth amplification.
//!
//! ## Security
//!
//! - All gossip envelopes are signed (Ed25519 with per-node asymmetric keys).
//!   Each node signs with its own private key; receivers verify using the
//!   sender's public key looked up by NodeId from the peer registry.
//! - Message hashes are verified on receipt: `blake3(payload) == msg_hash`.
//! - Pending IHave state is bounded to prevent memory exhaustion.
//! - Connections are bounded by the configured `max_connections` limit.
//!
//! The public API (`publish`, `subscribe`, `join_topic`) is unchanged from the original
//! eager-push implementation.
