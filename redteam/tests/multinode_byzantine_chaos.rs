//! # Multi-node Byzantine chaos — the operational test of the distributed invariants.
//!
//! Part A of the MULTI-NODE BYZANTINE CHAOS red-team. This builds an *in-process
//! cluster* of real `dregg_blocklace::finality::Lace` nodes (the SAME reception
//! path the running node drives: `node/src/blocklace_sync.rs::handle_push` →
//! `finality.rs::receive_block` / `merge`) and runs adversarial network chaos
//! against them. It then asserts — OPERATIONALLY, against the running Rust, not
//! just in Lean — the three distributed properties the metatheory proves:
//!
//!   * **CatchupConverges** (`Dregg2/Distributed/CatchupConverges.lean`): a node
//!     that receives the same causally-closed set of finalized blocks (in ANY
//!     arrival order, ANY delta grouping, ANY buffering) reaches the SAME
//!     finalized state as any peer. The operational witness of "same finalized
//!     state" is: identical content-addressed block-id keyset ⇒ identical tau
//!     ordering ⇒ identical executed state (the `catchup_converges_to_leader`
//!     chain). We check the keyset + the per-creator tip map + the equivocator
//!     set, which together pin the lace's finalized projection.
//!
//!   * **StrandIntegrity** (`Dregg2/Distributed/StrandIntegrity.lean`): the per-
//!     creator SSB feed is append-only, Ed25519-signed, monotone-sequence, and a
//!     second distinct block at one `(creator, seq)` is RETAINED as detectable
//!     `EquivocationProof` with the tip WITHDRAWN (never silently overwritten —
//!     the audit-A1 fix). We attack the write path (`Blocklace::insert` /
//!     `Lace::receive_block`) with forks and assert detection + tip withdrawal.
//!
//!   * **finality / Byzantine exclusion**: the equivocator is detected and
//!     excluded from honest tip state, while honest nodes still converge.
//!
//! ## What makes this a RED-TEAM and not a demo
//!
//! Every test genuinely tries to BREAK the property: it constructs the *worst*
//! arrival order, the equivocation that would slip past a naive single-tip
//! overwrite, the partition that would diverge two honest nodes, the replay that
//! would double-count, the flood that would OOM or desync, the eclipse that
//! would starve a node. A break that SUCCEEDS is asserted as a FINDING (panic
//! with a precise message); a break that FAILS is asserted as EVIDENCE the
//! property holds on the running Rust. The Lean proofs are about the abstract
//! model; these tests are the projection check onto the concrete code.
//!
//! ## IDENTITY MODEL (post PQ hybrid-identity sweep)
//!
//! `finality::Block::creator` is NO LONGER the Ed25519 verify key: it is the
//! HYBRID id `H(ed25519_pk ‖ ml_dsa_pk)` (`Block::hybrid_id`). The classical
//! verify key is carried separately in `Block::ed25519`, and it is `ed25519` —
//! not `creator` — that `verify_signature` parses as the verifying key.
//! `creator` is the identity LABEL keying `tips()`, `equivocators()` and the
//! roster. So every "is this creator flagged / does it still hold a tip?"
//! assertion below keys on `Block::hybrid_id(&key)`. Keying them on
//! `key.verifying_key().to_bytes()` looks up a label no block ever carries: the
//! query silently returns "absent", which reads as "no equivocation detected"
//! and "no tip" — the exact shapes these tests exist to catch. See
//! `blocklace_attacks.rs`, which was migrated first and is the worked example.
//!
//! ATTACK 9 is the exception, and deliberately so: it drives the `lib.rs`
//! strand-integrity path (`dregg_blocklace::Blocklace`), whose `Block::creator`
//! IS still the raw Ed25519 key (`lib::Block::new_signed`). That path pins the
//! post-quantum half to an ENROLLED roster key, so its creator must be enrolled
//! (`enroll_pq`) for the strand gate under test to be reachable at all.
