//! L4 — CAPABILITIES, ATTENUATION & THE CAP-CROWN, on the moldable-inspector
//! spine (`presentable.rs`).
//!
//! `reflect.rs` reflects a cell; this module reflects the **capability family**
//! — the ocap authority a cell holds and the lattice it sits in — through the
//! exact same `Presentable`/`Gadget` shapes the L1 spine defines. Nothing here
//! is reinvented: the partial order is the REAL [`AuthRequired::is_narrower_or_equal`]
//! (`cell/src/permissions.rs`), the non-amplification judge is the REAL
//! [`dregg_cell::is_attenuation`] (`granted ⊆ held`, `cell/src/capability.rs`),
//! the firmament handle is the REAL [`dregg_firmament::Capability`] (its
//! `attenuate` rides that same gate), the delegation neighborhood is the REAL
//! [`OcapGraph`] (`graph.rs`), the cap-crown root is the REAL openable
//! sorted-Poseidon2 root [`dregg_cell::compute_canonical_capability_root_felt`]
//! (`cell/src/commitment.rs`, the `#103` `capability_root`), and the mint path is
//! the REAL [`Powerbox::grant`] (`powerbox.rs`) — a genuine `GrantCapability`
//! turn through the verified executor.
//!
//! Two faces:
//!
//!   * [`HeldCapability`] — a thin newtype over one `CapabilityRef` a cell holds,
//!     lifted into the firmament [`Capability`] and offered as a `Presentable`
//!     set: RawFields · Lattice (the AuthRequired order with the held cap's
//!     position marked) · Graph (the ocap delegation neighborhood) · MerkleTree
//!     (the cap-crown membership readout, the real root + leaf digest of THIS
//!     cap's c-list) · Invariant (the `granted ⊆ held` non-amplification readout).
//!
//!   * [`AttenuationDial`] — THE attenuation dial: a [`Gadget`] that takes a held
//!     capability, designates a narrower rights tier, validates the narrowing
//!     with the REAL `is_attenuation` (refusing a widening fail-closed, in-band),
//!     and builds the attenuated firmament `Capability`. Where it MINTS into a
//!     grantee, [`AttenuationDial::grant_through_powerbox`] rides the established
//!     `Powerbox::grant` ceremony — the same verified-executor turn the cockpit's
//!     powerbox panel already drives. No parallel grant path.
//!
//! gpui-free + `cargo test`-able exactly as `presentable.rs`/`reflect.rs` are.
