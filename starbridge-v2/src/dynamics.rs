//! The live "dynamics" — an observation stream of state transitions.
//!
//! This is the model the visual layer renders, decoupled from gpui and from the
//! executor: a `World` EMITS [`WorldEvent`]s as it commits turns, and any view
//! (or test) CONSUMES them. It is the temporal/causal spine of the cockpit —
//! "cell born", "cap granted", "turn committed", "balance flowed", "receipt
//! linked" — the raw material for the cell-world animation, the blocklace
//! browser, and the activity feed.
//!
//! It is intentionally a plain append-only log with a cursor, not a callback
//! bus: views poll `since(cursor)` on each frame, which is trivially correct
//! under gpui's pull-render model and needs no shared-mutability plumbing.
