// build.rs — wire the Rust binary to the compiled Lean kernel + Lean runtime.
//
// We link against:
//   * libdregg_lean.a — a single static archive of the native objects emitted by the
//     Lean compiler for `Dregg2.Exec.FFI` and its ENTIRE transitive dependency
//     closure (Dregg2 modules + mathlib + batteries + aesop + Qq + … — ~8200 .o).
//     The SEED archive lives next to this build.rs at `dregg-lean-ffi/libdregg_lean.a`;
//     it was produced by compiling each module's `.c` (lake's `:c` facet) with
//     `leanc -c` and archiving with `llvm-ar` (see `scripts/seed-dregg2-closure.sh`).
//
//     ⚠ THE SEED IS **NOT** IN THE REPOSITORY. `dregg-lean-ffi/.gitignore:7` ignores
//     `*.a` and `git log -- dregg-lean-ffi/libdregg_lean.a` is EMPTY: the file has
//     never been tracked. (This header claimed "git-tracked" until 2026-07-24; several
//     warning strings below still say "no git-tracked seed" and mean the same thing —
//     no seed on disk.) A fresh checkout — every GitHub-hosted runner included — has
//     NO archive, so the `!build_archive.exists()` guard in `main` fires and this
//     script returns BEFORE emitting a single `cargo:rustc-cfg`. Get one with
//     `scripts/fetch-lean-seed.sh` (prebuilt, minutes) or `./scripts/bootstrap.sh`
//     (from source, hours). See `docs/ASSESS-cold-build-silent-export.md`.
//
// ── SWARM-SAFE ARCHIVE (the per-OUT_DIR working copy) ──
// The seed `libdregg_lean.a` is treated as a READ-ONLY SEED. A `cargo build`
// NEVER mutates it. Instead, each build copies the seed into a per-`OUT_DIR` working
// archive (`$OUT_DIR/libdregg_lean.a`) and does its splice → closure-completion →
// reachability-GC against THAT copy, then links against it. Because `OUT_DIR` is
// per-(crate, feature-set, profile) — cargo's own fingerprint dir — concurrent lanes
// with DIFFERENT feature sets each splice/prune their OWN archive and never tear a
// shared file. (Before this split the shared seed was rewritten from every build
// script invocation: two concurrent multi-feature lanes raced it into a torn /
// wrong-feature archive → `Undefined symbols: _initialize_Dregg2_*` across the swarm.)
// The seed is (re)produced ONLY out-of-band by `scripts/seed-dregg2-closure.sh` /
// `scripts/rebuild-dregg2-closure.sh` — never by a `cargo build`.
//   * the Lean runtime + stdlib in the elan toolchain `lib/lean` dir — STATIC by default
//     (leancpp/Init/Std/Lean/leanrt + gmp/uv/c++), or SHARED (libleanshared + Lake_shared)
//     when `DREGG_LEAN_LINK=shared` (the cdylib link mode, see `shared_link_mode`).
//
// Toolchain paths are discovered from `lake env` (LEAN_SYSROOT) with a fallback to the
// pinned elan toolchain, so this stays robust to elan being on PATH.

// ── THE REQUIRED-EXPORT MANIFEST ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// The symbols whose ABSENCE silently swaps a Lean-PROVEN decision for an unverified Rust twin (or
// an unaudited crate). "the archive links" is NOT evidence that any of them is there — every
// on-disk seed measured before 2026-07-29 exports NONE of them (`nm`: 126-142 `dregg_*` exports,
// of which only `dregg_captp_validate_handoff`, `dregg_coord_2pc_decide` and
// `dregg_exec_full_forest_auth_direct` are on this list's radar).
//
// ⚑ THAT WAS CALLED "SPLICE-ONLY" HERE AND IN `docs/ASSESS-cold-build-silent-export.md` §4, AND
// IT WAS THE WRONG READING — corrected 2026-07-29. Nothing about these symbols makes them
// unseedable. `scripts/bootstrap.sh`, `dregg-lean-ffi/scripts/seed-dregg2-closure.sh` and
// `scripts/lean-ffi-closure.py` each `lake build`-ed a hand-maintained NINE-ROOT list that was a
// strict subset of `Dregg2/FFI.lean`'s closure — 95 modules short, every one of them a decision
// module — so a seeding host emitted no `:c` facet for them and no seed could carry them however
// often it was regenerated. All three now build the one boundary root, and `lean-seed.yml` scrapes
// THIS manifest to refuse publishing a seed that lacks any of it. A future seed carries them; the
// already-published assets do not, and a build against one is a fully disarmed build.
//
// The manifest is the ARTIFACT-PROBED gate: it re-reads the archive we are actually about to link
// instead of trusting control flow, which catches every degrade path at once (including ones added
// later) and cannot be bypassed by a new early `return` upstream. It is used TWICE:
//
//   * BEFORE the splice — `archive_dregg2_complete` makes a missing export force `needs_splice`,
//     so a warm `.o` cache can never leave a freshly re-seeded archive un-spliced (see that fn).
//   * AFTER the splice — the `DREGG_REQUIRE_PQ_CORES` / `DREGG_REQUIRE_VERIFIED_EXPORTS` gates
//     below turn a missing export into a hard build FAILURE when armed.
//
// DELIBERATELY NOT ON THE LIST (they are the legitimately-optional exports, and a manifest that
// cannot distinguish "optional" from "absent" is a manifest someone turns off):
//   * `dregg_exec_handler_turn`   — has its OWN require_lean_native panic at the probe site.
//   * `dregg_exec_full_forest_auth_direct` — PERF only; absent ⇒ the JSON marshalling path, same
//     verified decision. (It is in the seed anyway.)

/// The verified post-quantum CORES. Absent ⇒ `dregg-pq` answers with an UNAUDITED crate.

///
/// `scripts/lean-seed-key.sh` already computes exactly that proposition's content:

///   2. its `KEY` still equals what `scripts/lean-seed-key.sh --key` computes RIGHT NOW from the
///      files on disk. The key script reads the worktree, not `HEAD`, so an uncommitted edit to
///      any closure module moves the key and the evidence evaporates on its own;
///   3. its `SHA256` still equals the digest of the archive actually on disk, so the record

///   undefined function symbol — `_lp_Dregg2_Dregg2_Games_PathOfAngels_SalvageCrate_genesis`, say —
///   is not an init edge, so it walks straight past it.
///
/// So on 2026-08-07 the archive shipped with `SlotDeriveRuntime.o` and `StationCrateOpen.o` both
/// CALLING `SalvageCrate.genesis` and no member defining it. Every gate here reported success; the

/// unlinkable, and every option other than refusing amounts to handing a downstream crate a broken

/// initializer of every TRANSITIVELY-imported module: `Dregg2.Exec.Kernel`'s init alone chains into
/// `initialize_Dregg2_Dregg2_Tactics` (→ `initialize_Lean`, the whole elaborator) AND the mathlib
/// `Tactic.Ring` / `Algebra.BigOperators` inits, which in turn chain across ~2600 mathlib members.
/// None of that proof-time code is CALLED by the executor's compute path (`Exec.recKExec` /
/// `execFullForestG`) — it enters ONLY through the init chain. The measured shape: the executor's
/// true runtime-FUNCTION closure is ~960 members / ~67 MB; the init-chain inflates the kept archive
/// to ~3000 members / ~138 MB (the elaborator + the proof-time mathlib/aesop).
///
/// This pass severs the init-chain edge at the SHAPE of the closure. It computes the
/// runtime-function/data reachable set from the `dregg_*` exports (following EVERY edge EXCEPT the
/// `initialize_*` ones, which are the boundary), keeps exactly those members in a separate trimmed
/// archive, and supplies a boundary NO-OP for each runtime-DEAD module initializer the kept members'
/// own init-chains still reference (the same mechanism the seL4 lane proved with `init-stubs.c` —
/// generalized from the single `Dregg2.Tactics` leaf to the whole runtime-dead frontier). The result
/// is a dead-stripped static embed of the VERIFIED executor at a fraction of the size, with the
/// elaborator/Mathlib never init-pulled.
///
/// Soundness: a module is dropped ONLY when no live member references any of its function/data
/// symbols — i.e. the executor never calls into it. Its initializer (which only built proof-time
/// constants) is replaced by an idempotent no-op so the live init-chain still links. The verified
/// `def`s and their proofs are untouched (proofs build in the full metatheory; this trims the RUNTIME
/// embed only). The kernel probe (`embeddable_runtime_probe`) drives a real transfer through the

    // ── FAIL-LOUD GATE (DREGG_REQUIRE_LEAN) — see docs/BUILD-LEAN-LINKED-NODE.md ─────────────
    // A distribution / CI / validator build REFUSES a silent degrade to the marshal-only shell
    // (`lean_available()==false`, the UN-verified Rust executor). Historically every marshal-only
    // degrade below emitted only a `cargo:warning=…`, which is trivially lost in a release/CI log —
    // so a build whose Lean seed was stale or gitignored could ship as if verified.
    //
    // The gate now has TWO tiers:
    //
    //   * EXPLICIT (`DREGG_REQUIRE_LEAN=1`) — `require_lean`: forces EVERY marshal-only degrade to
    //     a hard build FAILURE, INCLUDING the platform-incapable targets (wasm32 / zkvm /
    //     windows-msvc / no-lean-link). Use it to assert "this build must be a verified node" and
    //     fail loudly if the target can't be one.
    //
    //   * RELEASE-DEFAULT — `require_lean_native`: for a NATIVE, archive-linkable target, a
    //     `--release` (distribution) build defaults the fail-loud gate ON so a release binary can
    //     never SILENTLY ship marshal-only. This covers the archive-absent / sysroot-unresolvable
    //     degrades (the real "ships as verified but isn't" cases). It does NOT fire on the
    //     platform-incapable early return (those targets legitimately can't link Lean; only the
    //     EXPLICIT tier forces them). The opt-out for a deliberately-marshal-only release build
    //     (dev / benchmarks / a non-node crate) is `DREGG_REQUIRE_LEAN=0` (or `false`/`off`).
    //
    //   * TEST-LANE OPT-IN — `DREGG_TEST_REQUIRE_LEAN=1`: the SAME variable `lib.rs`'s
    //     `demand_lean` already reads to turn a runtime self-skip into a panic, now also armed at
    //     BUILD time. Without this, a `cargo test` lane was structurally unable to arm anything:
    //     `cargo test` is a DEBUG build, `require_lean_native` needed `--release`, so an absent /
    //     un-spliced archive emitted a `cargo:warning=` (which cargo HIDES for dependency crates),
    //     returned before every `cargo:rustc-cfg=` below, and each `#[cfg(dregg_*_present)]` test
    //     module simply CEASED TO EXIST. `cargo test -p dregg-lean-ffi --lib` then reported
    //     `11 passed` — not `0` — while all 9 verified-crypto/verified-decision assertions had
    //     evaporated. An opt-in rather than a debug default, because a legitimate local dev build
    //     with no Lean toolchain must keep working; the CI test lane opts in
    //     (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`, the `test` job). `docs/ASSESS-cold-build-silent-export.md`.
