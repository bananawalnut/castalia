# seed-dregg2-closure.sh — ONE-TIME seed of dregg-lean-ffi/libdregg_lean.a.
#
# The git-tracked `libdregg_lean.a` is a READ-ONLY SEED: a base archive holding the ~4300
# precompiled mathlib/batteries/aesop/Qq dependency objects (EXPENSIVE to regenerate — a leanc
# compile of the whole transitive `:c` closure). A `cargo build` NEVER mutates this seed. Instead,
# each build COPIES the seed into a per-`OUT_DIR` working archive and splices the fresh Dregg2_*.o
# (plus per-module closure completion) + reachability-GCs THAT copy — so concurrent multi-feature
# lanes never tear the shared file (see build.rs, the SWARM-SAFE ARCHIVE note).
#
# This script (re)produces the SEED itself — the one place the git-tracked archive is written.
#
# This script SEEDS that base from scratch: it `lake build`s the FFI module's whole transitive
# closure, then `leanc -c`-compiles EVERY emitted `.c` from EVERY IR root — the project's own
# (`metatheory/.lake/build/ir`: the Dregg2 + Metatheory modules), each git package's
# (`.lake/packages/*/.lake/build/ir`: batteries, aesop, Qq, …), and each `type: path` dependency's
# (mathlib, whose `dir` is read from lake-manifest.json) — and archives them all. The dependency
# `.c` live in THOSE trees, not the project's; scanning only the project IR would seed a
# dependency-less archive that cannot link.
#
# Run it once (or when the Lean toolchain / mathlib pin changes); EXPECT the first run to take a
# while (thousands of leanc invocations, parallelized to your core count). Afterwards
# `cargo build -p dregg-lean-ffi` copies this seed into its OUT_DIR and maintains the Dregg2 slice
# (+ reachability GC) on that per-build copy — the seed stays as produced here until re-seeded.
#
# Usage:  dregg-lean-ffi/scripts/seed-dregg2-closure.sh
#         (or just ./scripts/bootstrap.sh from the repo root, which runs this when needed)

# asking for Dregg2_Coord_*.o (2026-07-10)". The answer to that was a 9-entry hand list, and a
# hand list drifts: by 2026-07-29 it was 95 modules short of `Dregg2/FFI.lean`'s closure, missing
# EVERY verified light-client gate, the finality gate, cross-cell conservation, R3Verify and the
# storage content root — so no seed cut by this script could carry them, ever.
#
# `Dregg2/FFI.lean` imports `Dregg2.Exec.DistributedExports` and all six PQ cores by name; it is
# the manifest, and a closure cannot drift from itself.
