# rebuild-dregg2-closure.sh — RE-SPLICE the seed archive's in-tree slice from the current Lean.
#
# The seed (`dregg-lean-ffi/libdregg_lean.a`, gitignored — see below) is the base every
# `cargo build -p dregg-lean-ffi` COPIES into its own `OUT_DIR` before splicing and GC-ing that
# copy. A plain cargo build never writes the seed; this script is the one place its in-tree slice
# is rewritten. The expensive dependency members (mathlib/batteries/aesop/Qq, ~2900 objects) are
# carried across untouched — regenerating those is `seed-dregg2-closure.sh`'s job.
#
# ═══ WHAT CHANGED HERE ON 2026-08-07, AND WHY ══════════════════════════════════════════════════
# This script produced a seed that was BOTH stale and short, and neither showed up anywhere:
#
#   * IT SPLICED WHATEVER IR HAPPENED TO BE ON DISK. It never ran `lake build`, so the objects it
#     archived were compiled from whatever `.c` a previous build left behind. Now it runs
#     `lake build Dregg2.FFI` first — 1.8s warm — and that is the ONLY authority on whether the IR
#     matches the source. (Four modules' `.c` currently read OLDER than their `.lean` by
#     filesystem mtime and lake replays all 3315 jobs from cache: those mtimes moved on a
#     `git checkout`, the content did not. An mtime precondition here would refuse a correct tree.)
#   * IT SPLICED `find …/ir/Dregg2 -name '*.c'` — every warm object under the Dregg2 IR root, which
#     is 2241 modules, not the 334 in-tree modules of the `Dregg2.FFI` boundary closure. And it
#     touched ONLY `Dregg2_*`, so the 9 `Metatheory_*` and 1 `Polis_*` members of that same closure
#     were never refreshed at all. The member set is now exactly the closure, from
#     `scripts/lean-ffi-closure.py` — the same one `seed-dregg2-closure.sh` and
#     `check-lean-seed-closure.sh` use, so a seed and its checks cannot disagree about what the
#     closure IS.
#   * IT WROTE THE SEED BEFORE ANYTHING CHECKED IT. The result is now built at `$ARCH.new` and must
#     pass `check-lean-seed-member-freshness.py` (every member at least as new as its Lean) AND
#     `check-lean-seed-closure.sh` (the boundary object, in-tree coverage, self-linking) before it
#     is renamed into place. A re-splice that produced a stale or short seed used to succeed.
#
# The header also said "git-tracked SEED" in three places. It has NEVER been tracked
# (`dregg-lean-ffi/.gitignore:7` is `*.a`, and `git log --all -- dregg-lean-ffi/libdregg_lean.a` is
# empty) — it is a local build artifact that arrives by `scripts/fetch-lean-seed.sh`,
# `scripts/bootstrap.sh`, `seed-dregg2-closure.sh` or a colleague's rsync. That is precisely why
# its members can be a fortnight older than the tree with nothing noticing.
#
# Usage:  dregg-lean-ffi/scripts/rebuild-dregg2-closure.sh [--keep-backup]
# Exit:   0 the seed was replaced and both gates are green · non-zero the seed was NOT touched
