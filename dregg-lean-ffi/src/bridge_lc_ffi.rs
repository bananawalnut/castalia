//! `bridge_lc_ffi` — the FFI route-through onto the VERIFIED ETHEREUM light-client VERIFY-LOGIC
//! gate (`Dregg2.Bridge.LightClientEthGate.dregg_eth_lc_verify`, `@[export] dregg_eth_lc_verify`).
//!
//! # What this is (the light-client twin-deletion, crypto-carrier boundary)
//!
//! `eth-lightclient/src/{lib,finality,execution}.rs` decides the SAME accept/reject that
//! `Dregg2.Bridge.LightClientEth.verifyFinalizedUpdate` proves `eth_no_forgery` over — a Rust
//! TWIN of the proven Lean rules that can drift ("proven over a re-authoring, not the emitted
//! object"; `docs/FORMAL-ASSURANCE-LIGHTCLIENT-CIRCUITS-2026-07-25.md`). This module routes the
//! Rust VERIFY-LOGIC through the Lean gate, exactly as `distributed_ffi::verified_finalization_quorum`
//! routes the collector's quorum decision through `dregg_finalization_quorum`.
//!
//! The subtlety the gate is designed around: light-client verify invokes HEAVY crypto (BLS12-381
//! aggregate verify + SHA-256 SSZ Merkle folds). So ONLY the verification LOGIC crosses to Lean —
//! the quorum counting / ≥ 2/3 multiply-form threshold / committee-size + bitfield checks / Nomad
//! zero-participant floor / branch-DEPTH admissibility (6|7 finality, 4 execution). The crypto
//! PRIMITIVES stay in Rust as NAMED verified-FFI carriers and are supplied to the gate as their
//! boolean RESULTS:
//!
//!   * `bls_ok`      — `blst` (audited; the ETH-client reference; Galois SAW proofs cover the
//!                     field/curve arithmetic; a verified-pairing EverCrypt-grade leaf is the
//!                     honest research frontier). The `EthLeaf.blsSound` carrier.
//!   * `finality_ok` / `exec_ok` — the SHA-256 branch-reconstruction comparisons (HACL*/EverCrypt
//!                     SHA-256 is the project-default verified realization, replacing RustCrypto
//!                     `sha2`). The `EthLeaf.hashPairCR` carrier.
//!
//! `LightClientEthGate.ethVerifyDecision_refines` PROVES the gate's decision over these
//! projections is DEFINITIONALLY `verifyFinalizedUpdate`, so gating a node on `dregg_eth_lc_verify`
//! gates it on the decision `eth_no_forgery` is proven over. The Rust `verify_finalized_update`
//! becomes the crypto-primitive computer + a differential sibling, NOT the decider.
//!
//! # The ONE trusted projection (named, not hidden)
//!
//! `participant_count` is the popcount of the 512-bit field, computed by the Rust caller
//! (`SyncAggregate::count`) and supplied on the wire — precisely as `dregg_finalization_quorum`
//! trusts the collector to intern+dedup its `(signer,root)` tally and verifies the quorum DECISION
//! over it. The popcount is a mechanically-faithful `count_ones` sum; the VERIFIED content is the
//! threshold/floor decision. HARDENING (named): ship the raw bits and count in Lean.
//!
//! # Wire grammar (mirrors `LightClientEthGate.decodeEthWire` byte-for-byte)
//!
//! ```text
//! INPUT  := "cl=" cl ";bl=" bl ";pc=" pc ";bls=" B ";fl=" fl ";fr=" B ";el=" el ";er=" B
//! B      := "0" | "1"
//! OUTPUT := "1" (ACCEPT) | "0" (REJECT) | "ERR" (the gate could not READ the wire — NOT a verdict)
//! ```
//! (`cl`=committee length, `bl`=bitfield length, `pc`=participant popcount, `bls`=BLS aggregate
//! result, `fl`=finality-branch depth, `fr`=finality reconstruct result, `el`=execution-branch
//! depth, `er`=execution reconstruct result.)
//!
//! # Availability + fail-safety
//!
//! [`eth_lc_verify_available`] is true only when the linked archive exports `dregg_eth_lc_verify`
//! (cfg `dregg_eth_lc_verify_present`, set by build.rs) AND runtime init succeeded. When
//! unavailable (stale / marshal-only / cold-seed archive) the caller FAILS CLOSED — the ETH
//! light-client verdict is `Err`, never a silent Rust-twin accept. A wire that round-trips to
//! `"ERR"` leaves through the ERROR channel too — see [`decode_gate_bit`].

// whether the client may change WHOSE SIGNATURES IT TRUSTS. That second decision —
// `eth-lightclient::verify_committee_update`, reached from

// depth admissibility rule (5 Altair..Deneb | 6 Electra+) `&&`-ed with a SHA-256 fold, deciding
// which 512 public keys the light client would trust from then on. The verify gate was honest and

// `committeeRotationDecision_refines` proves (by `rfl`) the exported decision IS
// `verifyCommitteeRotation`, and `committeeRotationDecision_binding` is the payoff: given the named
// SHA-256 CR carrier, one beacon state root commits ONE next committee, so an accepted rotation
// cannot fork the trust anchor. Rust keeps the SSZ committee-root computation and the branch fold
// and supplies their RESULT — the same `hashPairCR` carrier boundary the finality/execution
// branches already use.

// Tendermint / Cosmos NON-ADJACENT (skipping) light-client verify
// ============================================================================
//
// The second Cosmos gate, `Dregg2.Bridge.LightClientTendermintSkip.dregg_tm_skip_verify`. It is a
// SEPARATE rule set, not a relaxation of the adjacent one, and the two cover DISJOINT height
// ranges (`tmSkip_height_disjoint_from_adjacent`):
//
//   * the `next_validators_hash` epoch binding is ABSENT — a skip target's validator set was
//     never committed by the trusted header, which is the whole nature of skipping;
//   * in its place comes the TRUST-OVERLAP threshold, in the audited verifier's own strict
//     multiply form `trustNum · trustedTotal < trustDen · trustedSigned`
//     (`TrustThresholdFraction::is_enough_power signed total = signed·den > total·num`), i.e.
//     strictly more than `trust_threshold` (canonically 1/3) of the TRUSTED epoch's voting power
//     signed the target — ON TOP of the full strict `> 2/3` over the target's own set;
//   * the height conjunct is `trusted.height + 1 < height`, the exact condition under which
//     `validate_against_trusted` takes its `else` branch and requires `is_monotonic_height`.
//
// The crypto boundary is identical to the adjacent gate's: the per-validator Ed25519 verification
// feeds BOTH tallies (`voting_power_in_sets` walks each validator set looking that validator's
// vote up in the one commit) and the SHA-256 validator-set hashing feeds `self_bind_ok`. The gate
// re-derives no crypto. `tmSkipVerifyDecision_refines` PROVES the composed decision over these
// projections is DEFINITIONALLY `tmSkipVerify` (`rfl`), so an `Accept` here is — with the named
// `sigSound` / `hashCR` carriers sound — exactly `TmSkipForeignValid`, whose fourth conjunct is
// the trust-overlap anchor. Fail-closed: archive-absent ⇒ `Err` ⇒ caller REJECTS.
//
// Wire grammar (mirrors `decodeTmSkipWire` byte-for-byte, SIXTEEN fields — deliberately not a
// superset of the adjacent gate's thirteen, so a mis-routed wire is `"ERR"`, never a verdict about
// the wrong rule set):
// ```text

// LOGIC crosses to Lean (the Nomad-law zero floor `claimed_balance ≠ 0`, and the anchor bindings —
// the update's carried `state_root` / `token` / `mapping_slot` must equal the TRUSTED ones), while
// the keccak-interleaved Merkle-Patricia path walk stays in Rust (alloy-trie's audited
// `verify_proof`) as a NAMED verified-FFI carrier supplied as its RESULTS:
//

//                           `[nonce,balance,storageRoot,codeHash]` account under `state_root`.
//   * `storage_proof_ok`  — the storage trie opens the holder's derived slot key
//                           (`keccak256(pad32(holder) ‖ pad32(slot))`) to the claimed balance under
//                           that account's OWN `storageHash`.

// carrier). `LightClientMptGate.mptVerifyDecision_refines` PROVES the gate's decision over these
// projections is DEFINITIONALLY `mptVerify` (`rfl`; it inherits exactly `mptVerify`'s `propext`, from

// ============================================================================
// Mina (Ouroboros Samasika / Pickles) light-client verify (verified route-through)
// ============================================================================
//
// Routes the Mina finality decision through the Lean gate
// `Dregg2.Bridge.LightClientMinaGate.dregg_mina_lc_verify`, exactly as `verified_eth_lc_verify`
// routes the ETH verify. What it replaces is NOT a Rust twin of a proven rule set — it is an
// UNVERIFIED and, measured on the shipped code, largely absent check:
// `bridge/src/mina_observer.rs::observe_settlement` took the MAXIMUM `blockHeight` out of whatever
// `bestChain` returned, subtracted the settlement's submitted height, and accepted on the
// difference. The returned blocks were never checked to form a chain, and with the shipped
// `best_chain_length` far below a mainnet `confirmation_depth` the settlement's own block was not
// even in the window.
//
// The twin-deletion boundary is drawn where the other three gates draw theirs: the ANCHORED-SEGMENT
// LOGIC crosses to Lean (non-empty segment; `anchor_height <= submitted_height`, without which the
// depth is measured from outside the exhibited evidence; the WITNESSED depth meeting the Samasika
// requirement), while the crypto/codec PRIMITIVES stay in Rust as NAMED carriers supplied as their
// RESULTS:
//
//   * `link_ok`    — the Poseidon parent-linkage fold result over the exhibited headers (the
//                    `LINK_OK` carrier; `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.LightClientMinaHashFold` DERIVES it
//                    from the chain rather than trusting a bit, and its terminal value IS the tip
//                    state hash).
//   * `pickles_ok` — the per-block Pickles/Kimchi Wrap-proof results (the IPA/FRI arc). ⚑ NO
//                    LONGER A CONSTANT: until 2026-07-29 the observer passed a compile-time
//                    `NEUTRAL_PICKLES_OK = true` here because it never fetched
//                    `protocolStateProof`. It now decodes every block's proof and asks
//                    `verified_mina_wrap_shape_ok` (below) for the PREAMBLE verdict. The arithmetic
//                    of a Wrap verify is still not in this bit — see that function's header for
//                    exactly what is and is not, and why the rest is fixture-bound.
//   * `canon_ok`   — the state-row canonicality results (`< p`). Poseidon's `absorbAt` enters every
//                    input through `(state + x) % p`, so a non-canonical field element is invisible
//                    at the digest and an anchor `A + p` reaches the same tip as `A`. DERIVED in
//                    Lean by the authored width gate `minaRowWidthGates` (254 bits, exact because
//                    `p > 2^254`).
//
// `LightClientMinaGate.minaVerifyDecision_refines` PROVES the gate's decision over these projections
// is DEFINITIONALLY `minaVerify` (axiom-FREE `rfl`), so gating the observer on
// `dregg_mina_lc_verify` gates it on the decision `mina_no_forgery` is proven over — and
// `minaVerifyDecision_depth_witnessed` turns an accept into "the confirmation depth is backed by
// that many exhibited, parent-linked, Pickles-proved blocks".
//
// ⚑ NOT decided by THIS gate: FORK CHOICE. It is an anchored-segment verifier, so two k-deep proved
// segments under different anchors are indistinguishable to it. ⚑ CORRECTED 2026-07-30: the old
// wording here was "and not by anything else in the tree ... formalized nowhere", and that is no
// longer true. `verified_mina_better_tip` / `verified_mina_head_advance` (below) run Samasika's
// `select` over binprot protocol states off the peer-to-peer wire. The scope limit on this gate is
// real; the claim about the tree was stale.
//
// ⚑ THIS EXPORT WAS ABSENT FROM EVERY ARCHIVE UNTIL 2026-07-29, under two successive wrong
// diagnoses. Neither "the gate is not rooted in `Dregg2.lean`" (it was, line 1536) nor "the
// committed SEED is stale" was the cause. The seed is not committed — `dregg-lean-ffi/.gitignore:7`
// ignores `*.a` and the file has never been tracked — and it carries NO splice-only export in any
// case. The cause was that `build.rs` builds one Lake target, `Dregg2.FFI`, and splices exactly
// `metatheory/Dregg2/FFI.lean`'s import closure; a module rooted only in `Dregg2.lean` elaborates
// but emits no `:c` facet. FIXED by importing both Mina gates in `Dregg2/FFI.lean`; the remedy for
// any archive still lacking them is a plain `cargo build`, which re-lake-builds and re-splices.
// Absent, this stays fail-CLOSED and loud: the observer refuses every settlement with
// `ObserveError::VerifiedGateUnavailable`.

// ============================================================================
//
// This is what supplies the `pk` bit above, and it exists because that bit used to be a
// compile-time `true` named `NEUTRAL_PICKLES_OK`. The observer now fetches every block's
// `protocolStateProof`, decodes the binprot `Mina_base.Proof.Stable.V2` in Rust (a CODEC —
// `bridge/src/mina_pickles.rs`: no field arithmetic, no group arithmetic, both Lean-authored),
// and hands the resulting COUNTS here. `Dregg2.Bridge.PicklesWrapShapeGate.picklesWrapShapeOk`
// renders the verdict, and `picklesWrapShapeOk_is_shapeOkRec` proves that verdict IS
// `KimchiVerify.shapeOkRec` — the `verifier.rs:810-830` preamble — conjoined with two length
// agreements a recursive Wrap proof owes. `real_block_wrap_shape_accepts` pins the accept on the
// REAL devnet block 539508, and `real_block_wrap_shape_refused_by_freeze` pins that the retired
// `prevLen = 0` form REFUSES it.
//
// ⚑ SAY THE RESOLUTION OUT LOUD, because "the observer now checks the Pickles proof" is exactly
// the sentence that will be over-read. What an accept here means is: THE PREAMBLE PASSES. It is
// the first seven lines of `to_batch`. It does NOT mean the proof verifies, and the rest of the
// verify is NOT reachable from a deployed observer today, for two independent reasons:
//
//   1. DATA. Every arithmetic check this tree has on a real Mina block (`MinaRealBlockGate` C5/C8,
//      `MinaRealBlockTranscript` C3, the `MinaWrap*` group and opening rungs) is `by decide` over
//      LITERAL constants dumped by `metatheory/fixtures/pickles-extractors`, which links openmina
//      + o1-labs `proof-systems` to get the verifier index, the SRS, `endo_r`, the linearization
//      and the 40-element public input. None of that is on the wire — the proof's
//      `messages_for_next_step_proof.app_state` is literally `()` — and that dependency graph is
//      deliberately outside this workspace's lockfile.
//   2. COST. Those theorems are kernel `decide`s, not functions of a proof. Measured on ONE block
//      (`docs/MINA-REAL-BLOCK-GATE.md` §6.1): 82 s for C5/C8, 153 s + 75 s for the opening rung,
//      ~3.5 h of serial kernel and ~28 GB peak for the terminal `⟨s, srs.g⟩` MSM. A per-block cost
//      in hours is not a light client at any scale.
//
// So the honest shape of the residual is: the preamble is RUNTIME-EVALUABLE and now runs; the
// arithmetic is FIXTURE-BOUND and does not. The next rung that is genuinely runtime-evaluable is
// curve membership of the ~58 group elements the decoder already parses — compiled Lean over
// `ZMod`, microseconds per point — and it is deliberately NOT done in Rust.

// MINA — the PER-ADJACENT-PAIR Pickles PROOF-CHAIN gate (`dregg_mina_proof_chain_ok`)
// ===========================================================================
//
// ⚑ WHAT THIS BINDS, AND WHAT IT STILL DOES NOT.
//
// `mina_observer`'s per-step table carried a residual that made the whole per-block Pickles rung
// weaker than it looked: **the proof↔block binding — NOTHING CHECKED IT.** An endpoint could
// serve block A's proof under block B's header and every check passed — the Lean finality gate,
// the depth witness, the Base58Check decode and canonicality, the parent linkage, and the
// byte-exact `Mina_base.Proof.Stable.V2` decode feeding `dregg_mina_wrap_shape_ok`. In its cheap
// form that is not a subtle attack: ONE real Mina proof, replayed under 290 fabricated headers,
// manufactured any confirmation depth for free, and the "availability obligation" the
// `NEUTRAL_PICKLES_OK` retirement claimed to buy cost an adversary exactly one proof.
//
// The obstruction is structural and it does NOT go away here. A Wrap proof's
// `messages_for_next_step_proof.app_state` is literally `()` on the wire, so the proof does not
// carry the block it proves. The block enters only as the verifier-SUPPLIED `app_state`, hashed
// with the VK's `dlog_plonk_index` and the accumulators into ONE Poseidon digest that is
// **public-input slot 12 of 40**; the other 39 slots are functions of the proof alone. Turning
// slot 12 into a COMPARISON means assembling the whole public input, and six of those 40 words
// (`combined_inner_product`, `b`, `zeta_to_srs_length`, `zeta_to_domain_size`, `perm`, `xi`) are
// DROPPED from the wire proof and recoverable only by `expand_deferred` — the front half of a
// Kimchi verifier — plus a 40-point MSM and two sponges. That rung is
// `docs/MINA-REAL-BLOCK-GATE.md` §6 and it is NOT this.
//
// What IS closeable, and is closed here, is the OTHER binding. Pickles recursion makes block N's
// Step proof verify block N−1's Wrap proof, so block N's own bytes carry two fingerprints of its
// parent's proof, in the clear, comparable with zero arithmetic:
//
//   * `messages_for_next_step_proof.challenge_polynomial_commitments[0]` = the parent's
//     `bulletproof.challenge_polynomial_commitment` (`sg`), and
//   * `messages_for_next_step_proof.old_bulletproof_challenges[0]` = the parent's
//     `deferred_values.bulletproof_challenges` (16 of them).
//
// MEASURED on 40 consecutive real devnet blocks (539761…539800, 39 adjacent pairs): 39/39 on
// BOTH fingerprints, 40/40 distinct `sg`, 0 self-naming blocks, 0 non-adjacent coincidences.
//
// So an accepted segment must exhibit a GENUINE CONSECUTIVE RUN of real Mina Wrap proofs, in
// order, of the length claimed. Replay, shuffle, splice and pad are all refusals, and depth past
// the real chain's own production is a refusal. It is still NOT a proof↔`stateHash` binding: an
// adversary holding a genuine run can re-label the headers those proofs are served under.

// ===========================================================================
// MINA — the PER-BLOCK proof↔`stateHash` DERIVATION (`dregg_mina_state_hash_word_ok`)
// ===========================================================================
//
// ⚑ WHAT THE BLOCK ACTUALLY IS, INSIDE A WRAP VERIFICATION.
//
// A Wrap proof's `messages_for_next_step_proof.app_state` is `()` on the wire. The block enters
// ONLY as the verifier-supplied `app_state`, and `blockchain_snark_state.ml:384` fixes that to one
// `Fp` element — the protocol-state hash. It is absorbed into a 93-element Poseidon over `Fp`
//
//     word12 = Poseidon_fp( index_to_field_elements(dlog_plonk_index)  // 56, the Wrap VK
//                         ‖ [state_hash]                               //  1, THE BLOCK
//                         ‖ (sg₀,chals₀ ‖ sg₁,chals₁) )                // 36, this proof
//
// and that digest is public-input WORD 12 OF 40. Word 11 is the analogous
// `messages_for_next_wrap_proof` digest, a 32-element Poseidon over `Fq`.
//
// MEASURED 2026-07-29 by `metatheory/fixtures/pickles-extractors/src/bin/state_hash_binding_export.rs`
// over six real devnet blocks (539795…539799 consecutive, plus the anchor 539508):
//   * `kimchi::verifier::verify` under each block's OWN `stateHash`  — 6/6 `Ok`;
//   * the same proofs under every FOREIGN `stateHash`                — 30/30 `Err`;
//   * public-input words other than 12 that move when only the header is swapped — ZERO.
// So a foreign header is refused by o1-labs' own verifier, and word 12 is the sole carrier.
//
// ⚑ WHAT THIS BINDING DOES NOT DO, AND THE MEASUREMENT THAT SETTLED IT.
//
// `docs/MINA-REAL-BLOCK-GATE.md` §8.5 proposed a cheap closed loop — word 12 → the 40 words →
// `public_comm` → the Fq-sponge → β, γ, α′, ζ′, "which ARE on the wire". THEY ARE NOT. The same
// run measured every adjacent pair of the six blocks: the child's
// `deferred_values.plonk.{beta,gamma,alpha,zeta}` matched the parent's Wrap oracles on 0/5, and
// the child's `sponge_digest_before_evaluations` matched the parent's Wrap `fq_digest` on 0/5. A
// Wrap statement's `deferred_values` describe the STEP proof it wrapped, not the previous Wrap.
// The only equation in `kimchi::verifier::verify` a wrong word 12 falsifies is therefore the
// TERMINAL IPA OPENING, whose honest per-block cost includes the 2^15-point `⟨s, srs.g⟩` MSM
// (rung 5h, unrooted at `228e51de7` for exactly that reason).
//
// So this is a DERIVATION with a decision over it, not a Wrap verification, and no caller may
// describe it as one. What it buys: the observer no longer treats a `stateHash` as a free-floating
// Base58 string — it hashes it, per block, in compiled Lean, and the digest it produces is welded
// (`Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.MinaWrapPublicInputFromHeader`) to the 40-word public input the whole
// in-kernel ladder is stated over, and (`word12_preimage_carries_the_chain_accumulator`) to the
// accumulator `dregg_mina_proof_chain_ok` compares against the parent block's own `sg`.

// MINA — THE ACCOUNT OPENING (`dregg_mina_account_state_ok`)
// ===========================================================================
//
// ⚑ THE FIRST THING IN THIS TREE THAT READS MINA *STATE* RATHER THAN MINA'S CHAIN.
//
// Everything above this line decides about headers, proofs and forks: `lc_verify`, `better_tip`,
// `head_advance`, `proof_chain_ok`, `state_hash_word_ok`, `wrap_shape_ok`. Not one of them can
// observe a balance, a nonce, or where a stake is delegated. dregg could follow Mina and could not
// see anything *in* it.
//
// `Blockchain_state.staged_ledger_hash.non_snark.ledger_hash` IS the Merkle root of Mina's account
// ledger, and `MinaBinprot` has decoded it since `Blockchain_state` stopped being discarded. So an
// account plus a 35-level opening against that root is a statement about Mina STATE, anchored in a
// header whose identity `MinaStateHashDerive` re-derives from the same bytes.
//
// ⚑ THE ROOT IS DECODED, NEVER SUPPLIED. There is no argument on this side by which a caller names
// the ledger hash it wants to open against: `accountInBlockLedger` runs
// `decodeProtocolStateRawChecked` over the exhibited bytes and reads the root out of the result.
// A decode refusal is a gate refusal (`the_gate_refuses_when_the_decode_refuses`), never a
// pass-through.
//
// ⚑ AND THERE IS NO RUST TWIN, deliberately. A Rust `Account.to_input` would be a re-rendering of
// openmina's `account.rs` — which of the account's fields are in the leaf preimage and in what
// order IS the whole content of the claim "this account holds this balance" — and its correctness
// would be a differential test against another implementation. `Dregg2.Bridge.MinaAccountOpening`'s
// header enumerates six ways to read that layout wrong (the `Fields.fold` order is REVERSED and
// there is no `List.rev`; the prefixes are `Mina*` not `Coda*`; `Merkle_path.t`'s tag names YOUR
// node's side, not the sibling's; `Untimed` carries `vesting_period = 1`, not 0; `txn_version` sits
// INSIDE the controller run; an `Auth_required` is THREE one-bit chunks, not one three-bit chunk) —
// every one of them still parses, still hashes, and fails the live-block guard. Rust here formats
// decimals, hex and `key=value`, and decides nothing.
//
// ⚑ WHAT AN ACCEPT MEANS, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. It says: at the tip whose protocol-state bytes
// these are, Mina's ledger contained an account with this public key, balance, nonce and delegate
// at leaf index *i*. It says NOTHING about that tip's canonicity — that is
// `dregg_mina_better_tip` / `dregg_mina_head_advance`'s question, and whether the header is the
// block it claims to be is `MinaStateHashDerive`'s. The three compose; this one does not subsume
// them, and no caller may describe an account accept as "the account is on Mina's best chain".

// ===========================================================================
// MINA — SAMASIKA FORK CHOICE (`dregg_mina_better_tip`) and the ROLLING VERIFIED HEAD
// (`dregg_mina_head_advance`)
// ===========================================================================
//
// `dregg_mina_lc_verify` above says in its own header what it does NOT decide: FORK CHOICE. Two
// k-deep, parent-linked, Pickles-proved segments under different anchors are indistinguishable to
// it. These two exports are that missing decision. They are authored in
// `Dregg2.Bridge.MinaForkChoiceGate` over the `select` rule formalized in
// `Dregg2.Bridge.MinaChainSelection` — short-range: the longer chain; long-range: sub-window
// density, then length, then the VRF digest, then the state hash — and Rust decides nothing here.
//
// ⚑ THE COMPARISON IS PAIRWISE AND MUST NEVER BE FOLDED OVER A CANDIDATE SET.
//
// `MinaChainSelection.beats_not_transitive` PROVES `select` has genuine 3-cycles at REAL mainnet
// constants (`decide`-checked, by two independent mechanisms). So "the best tip in a set" is not a
// function of the set: it depends on presentation order, and a peer that controls presentation
// order can walk a node around the cycle. `verified_mina_better_tip` therefore compares ONE
// candidate against the CURRENT head and nothing else. A `fold`/`max_by`/`sort_by` over candidates
// using this function is NOT an improvement over the loop — it is order-dependent by construction,
// and `MinaForkChoiceGate.head_can_be_walked_in_a_cycle` executes three legitimate Samasika
// advances that return the head to exactly where it started. Do not "clean this up" into a fold.
//
// ⚑ AND THE GUARANTEE THAT SURVIVES THAT. The head is a PREFERENCE and it can cycle; the finalized
// height is a RATCHET and it cannot decrease — `MinaForkChoiceGate.rollHead_finalized_monotone`, on
// ANY input, for ANY candidate, under ANY presentation order, including around the cycle
// (`the_cycle_moves_the_head_but_not_the_finalized_point`). That asymmetry is what makes running a
// pairwise head safe: the worst an order-controlling peer achieves is churning which tip we serve,
// never un-finalizing something. Callers must persist BOTH halves of `MinaHeadRoll` and must never
// write back a `finalized` they computed themselves.
//
// ⚑ THE WIRE CARRIES RAW BINPROT BYTES, AND THAT IS DELIBERATE. `e` and `c` are the lowercase hex
// of the `Protocol_state.Value.Stable.V2` bytes as they came off the peer, and `Dregg2.Bridge.
// MinaBinprot` decodes them IN LEAN (`decodeProtocolStateChecked`, which also refuses a block whose
// CARRIED constants disagree with the pinned mainnet ones). Rust deliberately does not know which
// bytes are `min_window_density`, which are `sub_window_densities`, or where the VRF output sits: a
// Rust decoder would be a mirror of openmina's `p2p-messages`, and its correctness would then rest
// on a differential test — a confession, not a mitigation. The only thing this side knows about a
// Mina consensus state is that it is a byte string a socket produced. A trailing remainder is
// allowed by the decoder (on the wire the protocol state is followed by the Wrap proof and the
// block body), so a caller may hand over the whole header prefix rather than slicing it.
//
// ⚑ `eh` / `ch` ARE A CLAIM THE GATE CHECKS — NOT AN INPUT IT TRUSTS. They are the two tips' state
// hashes as `Fp` elements in decimal, and `select` reads them ONLY as the FINAL tie-break, after
// `blockchain_length` and the VRF digest have both tied.
//
// ⚑ CORRECTED 2026-08-07, AND THE STALE VERSION OF THIS PARAGRAPH COST A WEEK-LONG RED. It said
// they are "the ONE SUPPLIED (NOT DERIVED) INPUT … re-deriving it is a separate Lean job that does
// not exist yet (`docs/MINA-LIGHT-CLIENT.md` carries it as an open row)". That job LANDED on
// 2026-07-30: `Bridge.MinaStateHashDerive.stateHash` recomputes `state_hash` from the same bytes,
// and `MinaForkChoiceGate.decodeSide?` REFUSES a side whose presented hash is not the one its bytes
// derive to. What that removed is concrete — a peer that could name its own tie-break could win
// every tie by claiming a larger hash while serving whatever bytes it liked.
//
// So a caller passes the hash the bytes HAVE, and a wrong one is `"ERR"` (fail-closed), never a
// verdict computed from what did parse. `mina_fork_choice_decides_on_real_devnet_bytes_through_the_
// real_ffi` still passed `"1"`/`"2"` for eight days after that landed and had collapsed to
// `KeepExisting` on every leg; the doc above is why it read as correct. It now pins the two
// numerals `MinaBinprotRealBlock` kernel-`decide`s.
//
// Everything else on this wire — including the Blake2b VRF digest — is likewise DERIVED from the
// bytes by the gate. Nothing on it is now taken on the peer's word.
//
// ⚑ WHAT AN ABSENT EXPORT COSTS. There is NO Rust twin of `select` and there will not be one; a
// hand-written Samasika in Rust is exactly the drift these gates exist to delete. Absent, both
// `*_available()` go constantly false, `verified_mina_better_tip` returns `Err` (never
// `TakeCandidate`) and `verified_mina_head_advance` returns `Err` (never an advance), so the client
// keeps whatever head it already persisted and its finalized height does not move. A light client
// that cannot choose between forks is stalled; one that guesses is forked. Stalled is the refusal.
//
// Wire grammar (mirrors `MinaForkChoiceGate.decodeTipPair` / `minaHeadAdvanceGate` byte-for-byte):
// ```text
// TIP        := "eh=" Nat ";ch=" Nat ";e=" HEX ";c=" HEX
// HEX        := an even-length string of [0-9a-fA-F]
// BETTER_TIP := TIP
//            -> "1" (the CANDIDATE is canonical, drop the existing tip) | "0" | "ERR"

//            -> "adv=" BIT ";fin=" Nat | "ERR"

// is ACCEPTED only when four conjuncts hold, and the fourth is that the batched MSM was actually
// EVALUATED and found to vanish (`deferral_gate_refuses_undischarged` is the permanent falsifier).
//
// ⚑ WHY THIS BINDING EXISTS, and it is a closed gap rather than a new feature. The export shipped
// in `libdregg_lean.a` from the day `Dregg2/FFI.lean:78` imported it and had **zero references in
// any `.rs` file** until 2026-08-04. Its `d=` field — the one that is not a shape read — was
// therefore whatever a caller wrote, and there was no caller. The gate checked well-formedness and
// TRUSTED an assertion of discharge; it computed no MSM, so
// `PastaIpaDeferral.opening_is_vacuous_when_sg_is_free` applied to the live runtime.
//
// `dregg_bridge::mina_accumulator_discharge` is the caller that earns the bit: it evaluates the
// `|G| + N`-point MSM natively over the real Vesta SRS and the real block claims, and `d=1` has
// exactly one constructor (`Verdict::wire_for`) which is gated on that MSM's result.

// ⚑ WHY THIS SECTION EXISTS, and it is not "a new feature". On 2026-07-30
// `Dregg2.Bridge.MinaWrapChallenges` landed, was rooted in `Dregg2/FFI.lean`, and `build.rs`
// probed its symbol and set `dregg_mina_wrap_challenges_present`. There was no `_str` bridge in
// `lean_init.c` and no wrapper here, so the archive carried the export and **nothing in the
// process could call it**. That is the GATING-DEFAULTS-TO-SILENCE class in its purest form: no
// broken code, no red test, a gate that cannot go red because it cannot be entered.
//
// ⚑ AND THERE IS NO RUST TWIN OF EITHER, deliberately. A Rust Fq-sponge is a re-rendering of a
// transcript, and a Rust linearization is a re-rendering of a circuit's meaning; both would be
// exactly the drift `Dregg2.Bridge.MinaChainSelection`'s gate deletes for `select`. Rust here
// formats decimals and parses `key=value`. Absent exports are `Err`, never a local computation.

// ===========================================================================
// MINA — THE PER-CHECKPOINT LOOP (`dregg_mina_checkpoint_advance`)
// ===========================================================================
//
// ⚑ WHY THIS SECTION EXISTS, and it is the THIRD instance of one class in three days. On
// 2026-07-30 `Dregg2.Bridge.MinaCheckpoint` landed with `@[export] dregg_mina_checkpoint_advance`,
// `Dregg2/FFI.lean` rooted it, `build.rs` added it to `REQUIRED_DECISION_EXPORTS`, declared
// `dregg_mina_checkpoint_advance_present` to `--check-cfg` and probed the archive to SET it — and
// there was no `shim.define`, no `_str` bridge in `lean_init.c`, and no `#[cfg(…)]` here. So the
// archive carried the symbol, cargo set the cfg, and **nothing in the process could call it**: a
// gate that cannot be entered cannot go red. `cfg_gate_declaration_audit`'s check #3
// (`EMITTED ⊆ USED`) is what found it, which is the point of that test.
//
// It is the same commit-shape as `2a64b61b4` (`dregg_mina_wrap_challenges`, exported/probed/cfg-set
// with no bridge at all) — the export and the plumbing were authored in one commit that was
// deliberately committed UNBUILT, and the plumbing half was three files short. Both halves land
// together here.
//
// ⚑ WHAT THE GATE IS. A TWO-TIER head the fork-choice pair above cannot express. Mina's Pickles
// proof is recursive, so verifying ONE block's Wrap proof attests the whole chain behind it; a
// client verifies at a CHECKPOINT cadence it chooses and runs a cheap provisional tier in between.
// The split is safe because `provisional_never_ratchets` proves a between-checkpoint step is
// DEFINITIONALLY unable to raise `finalized`, and `runSteps_finalized_monotone` proves the ratchet
// survives ANY interleaving of the two tiers. A longer cadence therefore costs LATENCY, not safety.
//
// ⚑ RUST SUPPLIES NO CHEAP VERDICT, deliberately. The parent link and the density RE-DERIVATION
// (`MinaSlidingWindow.step` from the decoded parent — strictly stronger than the bound check a
// served window gets) happen INSIDE the gate. A bit Rust computed and handed over would be a
// carrier for a decision. The ONE bit that crosses is `wrap_ok`, the Wrap arithmetic, which is
// arithmetic Rust did not do either — it comes from a prover, and an unavailable prover supplies
// `false`, never a skip (`checkpoint_without_the_wrap_verdict_moves_nothing`).
