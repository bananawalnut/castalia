//! THE POLIS AS A MULTI-INHABITANT SHARED GOVERNANCE WORLD, proven by RUNNING.
//!
//! A council of N **distinct inhabitants** — each a sovereign principal with its
//! OWN cipherclerk / signing key / cap-root, all joining ONE shared ledger — forms
//! an actor-bound `CouncilCharter` (membership + per-member signing key baked into
//! the cell's content-addressed program). One inhabitant PROPOSES (a real verified
//! DRAFT→PROPOSED turn); the others VOTE (real cap-gated turns, each authenticated
//! as a council member via the program's `SenderIs{member_key_i}` clause — the
//! deployed equivalent of the `SenderAuthorized` + membership-witness pattern); and
//! the M-of-N quorum gates the outcome BY CONSTRUCTION: the proposal cell advances
//! to APPROVED only at quorum (`AffineLe { M·flag − Σ approvals ≤ 0 }`), a
//! below-quorum certification is REFUSED by the executor, and a non-member vote is
//! REFUSED by the executor.
//!
//! Every governance step is a REAL verified turn on the embedded `TurnExecutor`
//! (`AgentRuntime`), and every safety property below is enforced by the cell
//! PROGRAM the factory installs — NOT by any SDK-side check. The negative cases
//! hand the executor a well-signed, well-formed turn and assert it rejects with
//! `TurnError::ProgramViolation`.
//!
//! THE POLIS FLOOR — *no subject's exit is foreclosed by the council's actions*.
//! What is EXECUTOR-ENFORCED here: the council's content-addressed descriptor
//! grants only a `CapTarget::SelfCell` template, and the installed program's
//! `state_constraints` bind ONLY the proposal cell's 16 slots. So no council turn
//! — proposal, vote, certify, or execute — can reach into a non-member subject's
//! OWN sovereign cell: the subject's balance, state, and exit (its ability to act
//! / move its funds) are untouched by anything the council does. We demonstrate
//! this by RUNNING: a non-member subject's cell is read before and after the full
//! M-of-N ceremony, and the subject independently spends from its own cell AFTER
//! the council has ACCEPTED — the council never foreclosed the subject's exit.
//! (The whole-world model-level statement — `polis_safety`, every controller
//! bounded by the floor for ALL subjects — lives in `metatheory/.../Polis.lean`
//! and is NOT what this test claims; this test demonstrates the DEPLOYED Rust
//! governance running, with the floor executor-enforced for this concrete world.)
