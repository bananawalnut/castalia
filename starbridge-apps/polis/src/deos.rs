//! # The polis governance families as composed [`DeosApp`]s — the deos-native surface.
//!
//! This is the **deos skin** over the pure polis library (`crate` — `council`,
//! `constitution`, `mandate`, `identity`). It is GATED behind the `deos` cargo feature so
//! the pure lib stays light (a `dregg-cell`-only constraint factory); only with
//! `--features deos` does polis pull `dregg-app-framework` and expose the live web surface.
//!
//! `docs/deos/DEOS.md` + `Dregg2/Deos/{GatedAffordance,WorkflowBridge}.lean`: a deos app is
//! the SIX kernel layers wired into ONE shape (cells × affordances, the SDK surface every
//! fire routes through, the web-of-cells distribution, the durable-state seam). Each polis
//! family is re-expressed as one small [`DeosApp`]: the family's `*_cell_program()` is
//! INSTALLED on the seeded cell (the soundness floor), and the gated fire submits a real
//! verified turn the executor RE-ENFORCES that program on — so the family's OWN lifecycle
//! caveat (the threshold / cooling / pinned-param / revoke / pre-rotation tooth) BITES
//! in-band, in the SUBMISSION path.
//!
//! ## The rights ladder, mapped per family — `Signature ⊂ Either ⊂ None`
//!
//! Every family exposes a three-tier ladder ([`crate::deos::OBSERVER_RIGHTS`] ⊂
//! [`PARTICIPANT_RIGHTS`] ⊂ [`AUTHORITY_RIGHTS`]):
//!   * **observer** ([`AuthRequired::Signature`], cap-only read) — a council member /
//!     amendment proposer / worker / identity device reads the cell;
//!   * **participant** ([`AuthRequired::Either`], cap∧state gated) — the actor who advances
//!     the machine one step (approve a proposal, invoke a mandate spend, attest a rotation);
//!   * **authority** ([`AuthRequired::None`], root) — the council authority / ratifier /
//!     mandate grantor / recovery authority who performs the decisive transition (ratify an
//!     amendment, amend a constitution, rotate an identity key, revoke a mandate).
//!
//! ## Slot 0 is the shared lifecycle state-code
//!
//! Every polis family shares [`crate::STATE_SLOT`] (= 0) as a lifecycle state-code (the
//! design's shared convention). Each gated op's deos PRECONDITION is therefore a small
//! `FieldEquals { 0, <expected-state-code> }` (or a numeric meter gate) read against the
//! cell's live state — the htmx tooth (the button DARK until the machine is in the right
//! state, LIT once it is). The INVARIANT (which approval slot is monotone, which param is
//! pinned, which transition is allowed) is the installed family program the executor
//! re-enforces on the produced transition.
