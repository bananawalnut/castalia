//! # polis — the council governance lifecycle as a SERVICE CELL on the
//! `invoke()` front door.
//!
//! The third axis (AX3) of a modern starbridge-app: the council
//! propose → approve → certify → execute lifecycle re-expressed as a
//! CELLS-AS-SERVICE-OBJECTS citizen (after the `bounty-board` /
//! `governed-namespace` exemplars). It publishes a first-class, typed
//! [`InterfaceDescriptor`] and drives the lifecycle through the
//! [`dregg_app_framework::invoke`] front door — the userspace method-dispatch
//! layer that sits *slightly above* the effect-VM and desugars a method call to
//! the ordinary verified effects it names. There is **no `Effect::Invoke`**, no
//! kernel change, no new circuit rung: the kernel and the light client keep
//! seeing only the [`SetField`](dregg_app_framework::Effect::SetField) /
//! [`EmitEvent`](dregg_app_framework::Effect::EmitEvent) effects they already
//! enforce and witness. The one extra fact — that an invoked method is a member
//! of the cell's interface — is decided by the SAME verified DFA router
//! ([`InterfaceDescriptor::route_method`]) the protocol already uses.
//!
//! ## Not a library module — the package-cycle dance
//!
//! Unlike `bounty-board`/`governed-namespace` (whose service face is a plain
//! library module), polis CANNOT take a normal `dregg-app-framework` edge:
//! `dregg-sdk` depends on `starbridge-polis` (it re-exports the pure cell
//! programs) and `dregg-app-framework` depends on `dregg-sdk`, so a `polis →
//! app-framework` edge would close the illegal package cycle Cargo rejects. So —
//! exactly like the deos surface (`src/deos.rs`) — this file is compiled INTO THE
//! TEST BINARIES via `#[path = "../src/service.rs"]` (see `tests/service.rs`),
//! where the framework dev-dependency is in scope. The pure library it drives is
//! reached by its external name `starbridge_polis::…` (NOT `crate::…`).
//!
//! ## Non-degrading: the SAME canonical council program re-enforces
//!
//! The service installs the IDENTICAL canonical
//! [`council_cell_program`](starbridge_polis::council::council_cell_program) the
//! [`council_factory_descriptor`](starbridge_polis::council::council_factory_descriptor)
//! bakes into every factory-born proposal cell. So the lifecycle teeth re-enforce
//! on every invoke()-desugared turn exactly as they do on a factory-born cell:
//!
//! | method    | semantics                | auth        | desugars to (the executor re-enforces) |
//! |-----------|--------------------------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
//! | `propose` | [`Semantics::Replayable`]| `Signature` | DRAFT→PROPOSED, stage hash + publish member-commit |
//! | `approve` | [`Semantics::Replayable`]| `Signature` | flip member `i`'s `{0,1}` `Monotonic` approval bit |
//! | `certify` | [`Semantics::Replayable`]| `Signature` | PROPOSED→APPROVED, arm flag (`AffineLe`: `Σ ≥ M`) |
//! | `reject`  | [`Semantics::Replayable`]| `Signature` | PROPOSED→REJECTED (terminal) |
//! | `execute` | [`Semantics::Replayable`]| `Signature` | APPROVED→EXECUTED (terminal; demands flag) |
//! | `view`    | [`Semantics::Serviced`]  | `None`      | — (the named OFE seam: a pure read, no turn) |
//!
//! The five mutators are **replayable**: they desugar (via `invoke()`) to a
//! verified turn whose post-state the executor checks against the council
//! [`CellProgram`]. `view` is **serviced**: the proposal's committed machine IS
//! the answer (it rides the OFE cross-cell-read,
//! `crossCellRead_refines_observedField`, not a replay), so `invoke()` refuses to
//! desugar it and names the seam honestly rather than faking a write.
//!
//! ## The verified guarantee (the program bites)
//!
//! The cap-gate (`Signature` on every mutator) is enforced twice over: at the
//! `invoke()` front door (an unauthorized caller is refused before any turn is
//! built — anti-ghost) and again by the executor (the desugared turn carries a
//! real signature the kernel verifies). The M-of-N gate is the verified executor
//! tooth: `certify` arms the flag only when `Σ approvals >= M`
//! (`AffineLe`), an un-approve is a `Monotonic` refusal, and the terminal
//! REJECTED/EXECUTED states have no outgoing transition row — all REAL executor
//! refusals on the invoke()-desugared turn, not userspace checks.
