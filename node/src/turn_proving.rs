//! Full-turn STARK proving on the node's finalized-turn commit path.
//!
//! This module makes the public claim — *every committed state transition is
//! proven* — TRUE for the running node. When the devnet enables full-turn
//! proving, [`crate::blocklace_sync::execute_finalized_turn`] calls
//! [`prove_and_verify_finalized_turn`] for each finalized turn:
//!
//! 1. **Prove.** The turn's effects (projected onto the actor cell) are
//!    marshalled into the Effect VM encoding via the cipherclerk's existing
//!    [`AgentCipherclerk::convert_effects_to_vm`] marshaller, and a real
//!    `FullTurnProof` (a composed STARK over the Effect-VM AIR) is generated
//!    with [`dregg_sdk::prove_turn_self_sovereign`].
//!
//! 2. **Verify → accept.** The freshly generated proof is *re-verified*
//!    against the actor cell's pre-state commitment (`old_commit`) and the
//!    proven post-state commitment (`new_commit`) using
//!    [`dregg_sdk::verify_full_turn`] — the same verifier remote peers use.
//!    Acceptance is **gated** on this check: if the proof does not verify
//!    against the expected commitments, the turn is *not* accepted as proven
//!    (the caller surfaces a rejection).
//!
//! The anti-ghost property is exercised in this module's tests: a turn whose
//! post-state commitment is forged (any felt off by one) is **REJECTED** by
//! `verify_full_turn`, because the Effect-VM AIR binds the new commitment at
//! its boundary row and the verifier checks it against the caller's expected
//! value (`CommitmentMismatch`).
//!
//! ## Soundness scope (honest)
//!
//! The Effect VM proves the actor cell's `(balance, nonce, fields, cap_root)`
//! transition. `old_commit` is the actor cell's pre-execution
//! `CellState::compute_commitment` and `new_commit` is read from the AIR's
//! boundary public input (the prover cannot forge it without producing an
//! invalid trace). This is the per-cell whole-turn binding the SDK FullTurn
//! phase established; it is the load-bearing commit-path leg the public claim
//! rests on. Cross-cell / multi-root aggregation is the Silver→Gold vision and
//! is tracked separately — it does not weaken what is proven here.
//!
//! ## FRESHNESS / no-double-spend (the LIVE binding this module wires)
//!
//! A finalized turn that SPENDS a note (carries an [`dregg_turn::Effect::NoteSpend`])
//! is routed through [`prove_and_verify_finalized_turn_freshness`] instead of the
//! plain self-sovereign path. That function attaches a **non-revocation** sub-proof
//! whose sorted-Merkle tree is built from the node's CANONICAL spent-nullifier set
//! (the persisted [`dregg_persist::Store`] nullifier set, folded into the field the
//! Effect-VM uses), and then verifies the composed proof through
//! [`dregg_sdk::verify_full_turn_bound`] with `expected_revocation_root` pinned to
//! that canonical root. This makes the SDK's two no-double-spend teeth FIRE on the
//! live commit path:
//!
//! - **binding (a)** [`FullTurnVerifyError::RevocationRootMismatch`]: the freshness
//!   proof must be against THE canonical nullifier set the node maintains — a
//!   prover-chosen (empty/stale) accumulator is rejected;
//! - **binding (b)** [`FullTurnVerifyError::NullifierMismatch`]: the item proved
//!   fresh must be THIS turn's spent nullifier, not some other item.
//!
//! ### Accumulator reconciliation (PolynomialAccumulator vs sorted-Merkle)
//!
//! The node has two distinct "absence" structures for two distinct sets:
//! `NodeState::revocation_accumulator` (a `PolynomialAccumulator` over revoked
//! capability-token hashes) and the persisted note-nullifier set (double-spend
//! prevention for `NoteSpend`). They are NOT the same set. The circuit's
//! non-revocation AIR ([`dregg_circuit::dsl::revocation`]) is a fixed-capacity
//! sorted-Merkle tree, so for note-spend freshness we make the **sorted-Merkle
//! tree derived from the persisted nullifier set** the canonical structure the
//! verifier pins. The derived root is a deterministic function of the node's
//! authoritative set (built here via [`canonical_revocation_root_for_set`]), so a
//! peer/light-client re-deriving it from the same set obtains the same root: the
//! verifier's `revocation_root` check is against the node's REAL set, never a
//! prover-chosen tree.
//!
//! ### Capacity bound (honest)
//!
//! The audited non-revocation circuit is hardwired to
//! [`dregg_circuit::dsl::revocation::TREE_DEPTH`] (`= 4`, a 16-leaf tree, so at
//! most `16 - 2 = 14` revoked entries after the two sentinels). When the canonical
//! nullifier set exceeds that capacity, a single fixed-depth proof cannot cover it
//! WITHOUT a deeper circuit (a circuit change, out of scope here). Rather than
//! silently truncate the canonical set (which would be UNSOUND — it could omit the
//! very nullifier being re-spent), [`canonical_revocation_root_for_set`] returns
//! `Err(RevocationCapacityExceeded)` and the spend turn is committed but carries NO
//! freshness-bound proof, logged loudly as a real limitation. Closing this needs a
//! depth-parameterized non-revocation AIR (tracked, not faked).
//!
//! ## AUTHORITY leg — WIRED (cap Phase D; the former blocker here is CLOSED)
//!
//! A capability-gated turn (receipt carries [`dregg_turn::TurnReceipt::consumed_capabilities`],
//! the cap Phase C executor witness) is routed through
//! [`prove_and_verify_finalized_turn_capability`], which attaches a
//! **cap-membership** sub-proof — the consumed capability's 7-field leaf proven
//! a sorted-Poseidon2-Merkle member of the holder's pre-state openable
//! `capability_root` (cap Phase A) — and gates acceptance on
//! [`dregg_sdk::verify_full_turn_bound`] with a [`dregg_sdk::CapMembershipExpectation`]
//! pinning BOTH the leg's root (to the node's CANONICAL pre-state capability
//! root) and its leaf digest (to the receipt-disclosed consumed-cap preimage).
//! The two former gaps are gone: the cap_root IS an openable membership root
//! the circuit seeds from (Phase A), and the executor DOES thread the consumed
//! witness (Phase C) — so the leg is a real binding, not a free body-fact wire.
