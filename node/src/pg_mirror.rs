//! The LIVE node → postgres mirror writer (pg-dregg M2).
//!
//! # The one material gap this closes
//!
//! `docs/PG-DREGG.md` §8 ships the mirror *core* — the SQL-row projection, the
//! universal-memory model, the DDL, and the anti-substitution [`RootChain`] —
//! and proves it with plain `cargo test` (no postgres) in `pg-dregg/src/mirror.rs`.
//! What it could NOT ship from there is the half that needs `dregg-cell`: the
//! decode of a live committed turn into those rows, and the act of shipping them.
//! That decode-and-ship is THIS module. It is the only part of the mirror story
//! that lives node-side, exactly because the node is the only crate that holds
//! both `dregg-cell` (to read a `Cell`) and the durable commit log (to read a
//! verified turn).
//!
//! # The spine invariant (preserved)
//!
//! > **Reads are free SQL; state mutates ONLY through verified turns.**
//!
//! The node is the ONLY writer. By the time a [`CommitRecord`] exists, the
//! kernel already verified and durably committed that turn (`persist`'s
//! commit-log discipline) — so the rows this module builds ARE a verified-turn
//! post-image. The mirror never executes, never authorizes, never decides; it
//! projects an already-final turn and ships it.
//!
//! And the pg side does NOT trust the stream: it RE-VALIDATES every batch with
//! its own [`RootChain`] (the post-state root of turn *N* must be the pre-state
//! root of turn *N+1*), so a tampered / reordered / forged batch is refused
//! WITHOUT re-running the verifier. The chain tooth here on the node is the same
//! check the pg side runs — we ship only batches that chain, so a correct node
//! never produces a batch the pg side would reject, and a tampered batch (e.g. a
//! row whose post-state was altered, changing the cell root and thus the ledger
//! root) breaks the chain on BOTH sides.
//!
//! # No reinvention
//!
//! The projection types ([`CellRow`], [`CapRow`], [`MemCell`], [`TurnRow`]), the
//! batch ([`MirrorBatch`]), and the [`RootChain`] all come from `pg-dregg`'s
//! `mirror` module. This module only (a) decodes `dregg_cell::Cell` into those
//! rows — the one piece pg-dregg deliberately cannot do (it has no `dregg-cell`)
//! — and (b) calls [`MirrorBatch::from_parts`] + [`RootChain`] to assemble and
//! gate. The SQL shape, the ordinal-stamping discipline, and the
//! anti-substitution tooth stay in their real home.
