//! lean_apply.rs — THE SWAP state-producer: reconstitute a `cell::Ledger` from the verified
//! Lean executor's produced `WireState`.
//!
//! # The authority inversion (Stage 0 / CRITICAL-1)
//!
//! On the COVERED set the verified Lean executor (`dregg_exec_full_forest_auth` / `execFullForestG`,
//! fully proven) is the AUTHORITATIVE state producer AND verdict: `produce_via_lean` installs
//! its post-state and commit decision UNCONDITIONALLY, and demotes the legacy Rust `TurnExecutor` to
//! a checked REFERENCE that is verified AGAINST. A Lean↔Rust disagreement on a covered turn is a
//! surfaced RUST BUG (Rust is the artifact dregg2 replaces *because it is buggy*), NEVER a fallback
//! that lets the Rust path win. This is a refinement, not a differential: the verified producer's
//! output is what gets committed, not gated behind agreement with the thing it replaces.
//!
//! The enabling mechanism — which `dregg-lean-ffi/src/marshal.rs` named as "the biggest gap" — is a
//! `WireState → cell::Ledger` extractor. This module is that extractor: `dregg_lean_ffi`'s
//! `decode_shadow_state` keeps the post-state `WireState`, and here we map it back onto real
//! `CellId`s and reconstitute the authoritative ledger, so the verified executor's output IS the
//! committed state. The receipt the commit path chains is re-stamped to attest the installed (Lean)
//! root, so the receipt and the ledger agree on the authoritative post-state.
//!
//! # The id seam
//!
//! The wire carries cells by a `u64` Nat (`marshal::cell_id_to_nat`'s codomain). The pre-state
//! snapshot assigned each referenced `CellId` a Nat via the SAME deterministic sorted scheme the
//! shadow marshaller uses (`lean_shadow::collect_id_map`). We invert that map (Nat → `CellId`) to
//! put the produced balances/nonces/fields back on the right cells. A produced cell whose Nat is
//! not in the inverse map is a marshaller gap (a created cell with a fresh, above-range Nat) and is
//! reported, never silently dropped.
//!
//! # Root computation (deliberately Rust-side)
//!
//! Lean produces the STATE; the EXISTING Rust hashing (`Ledger::root` / `hash_cell` =
//! `compute_canonical_state_commitment`) computes the commitment. We do NOT ask Lean to compute the
//! root — root-scheme unification is a separate later task. Here: Lean produces the cells, Rust
//! hashes them.
//!
//! # What the cell commitment binds — and the wire-model swap-gaps it reveals
//!
//! `compute_canonical_state_commitment` hashes, per cell:
//! `(balance, nonce, fields[0..STATE_SLOTS], permissions, verification_key, cap_root, lifecycle, program)`.
//! So for the Lean-produced ledger's `.root()` to equal the Rust-produced one, the reconstitution
//! must install the post-state of EVERY one of those that an effect can touch. The verified
//! `WireState` carries enough to reconstitute:
//!   * `balance` (via the per-asset `bal` side-table) — Transfer / Burn;
//!   * `nonce`, `fields[0..STATE_SLOTS]` (the cell record) — SetField / IncrementNonce;
//!   * `cap_root` (via the `caps` side-table → [`rebuild_capabilities`]) — best-effort, lossy.
//!
//! The `WireState` does NOT carry several commitment-bound payloads — but for the SURVIVOR effects
//! whose payload comes from the TURN or the HOST (not from kernel state), the reconstitution
//! replays the exact deterministic mutation onto the template pre-state, GATED by the verified
//! kernel's commit decision (the same lever for all of them, see [`CapOp`] and [`StateOp`]):
//!   * **`lifecycle`** — the wire `lifecycle` table carries the DISCRIMINANT only; the Rust
//!     commitment binds the Sealed/Destroyed PAYLOAD (`reason_hash`/`sealed_at`,
//!     `death_certificate_hash`/`destroyed_at`). Those payloads are turn (`CellSeal { reason }`,
//!     the `CellDestroy` certificate) + host (`block_height`) data, so [`apply_state_ops`] replays
//!     `Cell::seal`/`Cell::unseal`/`Cell::destroy` byte-for-byte → CLOSED.
//!   * **`permissions`** / **`verification_key`** — the wire `setperms`/`setvk` arms carry a
//!     collapsed scalar; the full struct is turn-supplied, so the replay installs it exactly
//!     (`apply_set_permissions` / `apply_set_verification_key` mirrors) → CLOSED.
//!   * **MakeSovereign** — the verified `sovereignRebind` re-emits the cell as a commitment-only
//!     record (no readable scalars); Rust REMOVES the cell from `Ledger::cells`. The replay calls
//!     `Ledger::make_sovereign` on the reconstituted ledger (the same structural removal +
//!     `sovereign_commitments` insert) → CLOSED.
//!   * **RevokeDelegation** — a committing revoke bumps the PARENT's `delegation_epoch` and clears
//!     the CHILD's `delegation` snapshot (both commitment-bound); neither crosses the wire, but the
//!     mutation is fully deterministic from the turn (`bump_delegation_epoch` + `delegation = None`)
//!     → CLOSED.
//!   * **cap fidelity** — the wire `caps` model is `(target[, rights])` per edge; the Rust
//!     `cap_root` hashes `(target, slot, permissions, breadstuff, expires_at, allowed_effects)`. A
//!     GrantCapability/Introduce/AttenuateCapability leaf is reconstructed exactly by
//!     [`apply_cap_ops`] (see [`rebuild_capabilities`] for the lossy edge-only fallback).
//!
//! Off-cell-commitment side-tables — escrows, queues, swiss, nullifiers, commitments — do NOT feed
//! `cell::Ledger::root()` at all (the Rust `TurnExecutor` keeps them OUTSIDE the `Ledger`), so an
//! escrow/queue/note effect's cell-ledger reconstitution agrees on `.root()` as long as it leaves
//! the touched CELLS' commitment fields unchanged — which they do (those effects are bal/structural,
//! not cell-scalar). The differential exercises a representative turn per family to pin exactly
//! which families round-trip and which are gaps.
