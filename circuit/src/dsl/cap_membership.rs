//! Capability-membership DSL circuit (cap Phase D): a STARK that a leaf digest
//! is a member of the canonical **openable** capability tree
//! ([`crate::cap_root::CanonicalCapTree`] — the sorted binary Poseidon2 Merkle
//! tree whose root is the cell's `capability_root` since cap Phase A).
//!
//! ## Why this exists (the AUTHORITY payoff leg)
//!
//! Phase B proves capability membership IN-ROW for the Attenuate/Grant
//! EffectVm selectors (the non-amplification gates). Every OTHER verb's
//! capability-gated turn needs a STANDALONE membership leg the composed
//! full-turn proof can carry: "the consumed capability's 7-field leaf is a
//! member of the holder's pre-state `capability_root`". The Phase-C executor
//! witness ([`dregg_turn::TurnReceipt::consumed_capabilities`]) supplies the
//! leaf preimage + sorted-Merkle path; this circuit proves the path, and
//! `dregg_sdk::verify_full_turn_bound` pins its two public inputs:
//!
//!   * `pi[LEAF_DIGEST]` — the Poseidon2 digest of the consumed cap's 7-field
//!     leaf preimage (the verifier recomputes it from the receipt's witnessed
//!     fields, so a leaf-field tamper mismatches);
//!   * `pi[CAP_ROOT]` — the Merkle root the path reaches (the verifier pins it
//!     to the holder's CANONICAL pre-state `capability_root`, so a path into a
//!     prover-chosen tree mismatches).
//!
//! ## The statement (depth = [`CAP_TREE_DEPTH`], binary `cap_node` nodes)
//!
//! The trace is exactly `CAP_TREE_DEPTH` rows (16 — a power of two, no
//! padding), one per tree level, bottom-up:
//!
//! ```text
//! row r:  cur_r  ∈ {left_r, right_r}   (selected by dir_r ∈ {0,1})
//!         parent_r = cap_node(left_r, right_r)        (in-circuit Poseidon2)
//!         cur_{r+1} = parent_r                        (chain continuity)
//! row 0:  cur_0 = pi[LEAF_DIGEST]
//! last:   parent  = pi[CAP_ROOT]
//! ```
//!
//! `cap_node(left, right)` (= `cap_chip_absorb([FACT_MARK, left, right])`, the
//! SINGLE in-circuit cap hash since decision #1) is byte-identical to the node
//! hash [`CanonicalCapTree`] builds with (the in-circuit gadget
//! `dsl_p3_air::hash_input_state` mirrors it via the `Hash3Cap` form), so the
//! proven root IS the canonical capability root. All five constraints are forms
//! the audited `prove_dsl_p3`/`verify_dsl_p3` path arithmetizes for real (no
//! bespoke `stark`).
