//! Descriptor IR v2 — the EPOCH multi-table interpreter (`docs/EPOCH-DESIGN.md`).
//!
//! `lean_descriptor_air.rs` PART 6 interprets the SINGLE-table v1 EffectVM descriptor
//! (`emitVmJson`): per-row hash sites cost a 352-column Poseidon2 aux block each, and range
//! teeth cost one boolean column per bit. This module interprets the VERSIONED v2 wire
//! (`Dregg2.Circuit.DescriptorIR2.emitVmJson2`, `"ir":2`), whose grammar makes hashing a
//! BOUNDARY phenomenon: the descriptor declares TABLES and RELATIONS, and the Rust side
//! assembles a MULTI-TABLE batch STARK (`p3-batch-stark` + the `p3-lookup` LogUp argument)
//! whose instances are
//!
//!   * **main** — one trace row per effect row; interprets the embedded v1 constraint forms
//!     (`gate`/`transition`/`boundary`/`pi_binding`) on the same domains the v1 AIR used, and
//!     realizes every declared `lookup`/`mem_op`/`map_op` as a bus interaction;
//!   * **poseidon2 chip** — one row per permutation `(arity, inputs padded to rate 8, output)`,
//!     each row pinned to the REAL Poseidon2 round constraints (`poseidon2_permute_expr`) so
//!     the table is sound in exactly the sense of Lean's `ChipTableSound`; hash-site lookups
//!     ride the `ir2_p2` bus (the measured 85% lever — one aux block per UNIQUE permutation,
//!     not per row × site);
//!   * **range** — the shared `[0,256)` byte table; a declared `lookup` into the range table
//!     (`rangeLimb bits`) is realized by byte-limb decomposition + LogUp byte queries + a
//!     tight top-limb bit bound (the proven `lean_lookup_air` shape; the realized relation is
//!     exactly `v ∈ [0, 2^bits)` = Lean's `range_row_mem_iff`);
//!   * **memory** — one row per state access, in log order: the offline-memory-checking
//!     instrumentation. The main AIR SENDS each guarded `(addr, value, prev_value,
//!     prev_serial, kind)` op on a permutation-check bus and the memory table RECEIVES it
//!     (exact multiset equality = Lean's `memTableFaithful`); the table's own AIR enforces the
//!     Blum discipline (positional serials, `prev_serial < serial` by range, read ⇒
//!     `value = prev_value`) and runs the read/write multiset argument
//!     (`init + writes = reads + final`, Lean `MemCheck`) on a second permutation bus against
//!     a boundary instance (declared addresses, strictly increasing ⇒ `Nodup`; address
//!     closure by lookup). Soundness of balance ⇒ consistency is the PROVED
//!     `Dregg2.Crypto.MemoryChecking.memcheck_sound`;
//!   * **map-ops** — one row per boundary reconciliation `(root, key, value, op) → new_root`,
//!     each row verifying a REAL sorted-Poseidon2-Merkle opening (leaf `hash[key, value]`,
//!     nodes `hash_fact(l, [r])`, depth 16 — byte-identical to
//!     `heap_root::CanonicalHeapTree`): `read` authenticates the leaf under `root` and pins
//!     `new_root = root`; `write` is the in-place sorted-tree leaf UPDATE (old leaf under
//!     `root`, new leaf over the SAME siblings to `new_root` — `HeapUpdateWitness`'s shape).
//!     Every permutation of the opening RIDES THE CHIP BUS (the leaf hashes as arity-2
//!     `ir2_p2` lookups, the node hashes as `ir2_fact` lookups into fact-marked chip rows) —
//!     the map row carries only the opening's spine (key/value/sibs/dirs + the 32 chain
//!     digests), never an in-row aux block. Main sends each guarded op; the table receives
//!     it (`mapTableFaithful`).
//!
//! **Descriptor-empty tables are NOT committed.** The batch is assembled over only the
//! tables the descriptor actually uses (a function of the constraint list alone, so prover
//! and verifier agree): the chip table iff any chip lookup or map op, the byte table iff any
//! range lookup or mem op, memory+boundary iff any mem op, map-ops iff any map op. FRI
//! opening cost is per-query × the row width of every committed matrix, so committing a
//! padded empty table is pure regression (`docs/PROOF-ECONOMICS.md` §2b measured the empty
//! map-ops table alone at ~1.7 MiB per transfer proof).
//!
//! **The law: Rust authors NO constraints.** Every enforced relation here is the realization
//! of a DECLARED descriptor element (a v1 form, a lookup into a declared table, a mem op, a
//! map op); the per-table AIRs discharge the per-table faithfulness obligations Lean names
//! (`ChipTableSound`, the faithful range table, `memTableFaithful`+`MemCheck`+`Disciplined`,
//! `mapTableFaithful`+`opensTo`/`writesTo`). Which wires are constrained is entirely the
//! descriptor's (= Lean's) choice.
//!
//! Two ADDITIVE table families ride the same batch, recursion-gated like everything here,
//! committed only when a descriptor uses them (`docs/UNIVERSAL-MEMORY.md` /
//! `docs/UNIVERSAL-MAP-ROTATION.md` §2.2):
//!
//!   * **map-absent** — one row per `map_op` kind `absent`: the bracketed sorted-gap
//!     NON-MEMBERSHIP opening (Lean `opensTo … none` via `opensTo_none_of_gap`): two
//!     membership paths at ADJACENT leaf positions under the same root, with
//!     `lo_addr < key < hi_addr` enforced by canonical-BabyBear-decomposition lexicographic
//!     comparators (`key = hi4·2^27 + lo27`, unique by the `is15·lo27 = 0` tooth since
//!     `p − 1 = 15·2^27` — full-felt hash-image keys order soundly). This is the
//!     once-per-touched-address boundary leg of `nullifier_fresh_binds_root`.
//!   * **umemory + umem-boundary** — the UNIVERSAL memory: `umem_op` constraints address the
//!     `Domain × κ` space as a literal `(domain, key)` pair with `Option`-valued cells
//!     `(present, value)`; ONE Blum multiset covers every domain
//!     (`UniversalMemory.universal_memory_sound`), with ZERO intra-proof hashing — a
//!     umem-only descriptor commits NO chip table (measured: a write+read-back is 67.6 KiB
//!     against 128.7 KiB for the same write as a boundary map op). Nullifier freshness is
//!     ONE read row with `present = 0` (`nullifier_fresh_sound` — no Merkle path, no gap
//!     opening); the nullifier domain's INSERT-ONLY discipline is an in-table tooth. The
//!     boundary table's declared `(domain, key)` list is Nodup by domain-major
//!     lexicographic strict increase over the canonical decomposition.
//!
//! ## Honest boundary notes (named, with their closure lanes)
//!
//!   * `map_op` kind `write` is realized as the in-place leaf UPDATE at an existing key
//!     (exactly `Heap.set` when the key is present — the cap-crown phase-B shape). A
//!     fresh-key sorted INSERT shifts leaf positions; its bracketed-insert witness can now
//!     reuse the map-absent adjacency/gap machinery and rides the nullifier-insert lane.
//!   * The universal-memory tables are the INTERIOR argument only: map roots remain derived
//!     boundary views reconciled by map ops at the proof's edge (today's map-ops machinery,
//!     once per touched key per proof — `boundary_root_from_memcheck` is the Lean anchor
//!     that both regimes commit to the same object). The full table-collapse (per-map tables
//!     subsumed for ALL live descriptors) is flag-day work by the spec's §3 ordering: it
//!     rides THE ONE ROTATION with the 3-verb executor, never before it.
//!   * The universal boundary image (`uinit`/`ufin`/declared `(domain, key)` list) is
//!     witness-supplied (`UMemBoundaryWitness`), exactly like the flat memory boundary. The
//!     INIT image is BOUND to committed PRE-state per-cell by a `MapOp::Read` opening each
//!     declared init cell against a committed-root PUBLIC INPUT (the PI-v3 ride-along; Lean
//!     anchor `UniversalMemory.boundary_init_root_derived` + the injectivity tooth
//!     `boundary_init_root_bound`, lifted to the IR as `DescriptorIR2.satisfied2U_init_root`).
//!     This is exactly `boundary_root_derived`'s `hsem` realized per address: the opened cell
//!     genuinely lives in the committed map whose root is published — a forged peer root has no
//!     membership path, a forged value opens to the genuine leaf. It is the WITNESSED
//!     CROSS-CELL-READ primitive (the circuit twin of the executor-only
//!     `StateConstraint::ObservedFieldEquals`); see `tests/effect_vm_umem_real_turn.rs`. The
//!     whole-IMAGE equality (the no-extra-cells direction) is now ASSEMBLED IN LEAN against the
//!     DEPLOYED binary-Merkle peer-root leg — `UniversalBridge.crossCellRead_whole_image`
//!     (+ `_sem` / `cross_cell_read_no_extra_cell` / `_teeth`), the binary-`mapRoot_injective`
//!     companion of the per-cell `crossCellRead_refines_observedField`, exactly as the flat-sponge
//!     `UniversalMemory.boundary_whole_image_sem` (lifted to the IR as
//!     `DescriptorIR2.satisfied2U_init_whole_image`) carries it over `Heap.root_injective`: pin the
//!     published peer root to the binary fold of the ENTIRE declared whole-boundary view and, under
//!     the CR floor, the committed peer heap agrees with the declared image at EVERY address
//!     INCLUDING absence off the declared list (no extra cells — a hidden cell cannot survive the
//!     pin). The Lean theorem's `hpin` hypothesis — an AIR that COMPUTES the whole-boundary binary
//!     fold (`mapRoot hash d boundaryHeap`, the sorted-leaf fold to the `2^d`-leaf root) and pins
//!     it to the published-root public input — is now REALIZED in `crate::whole_image_fold` (the
//!     WHOLE-IMAGE FOLD CHIP): a sorted-`MapKind::Insert` chain from the empty root reconstructs the
//!     deployed binary fold over the ENTIRE declared boundary view and `PiBinding`s the delivered
//!     fold to the published root, so a peer heap with one undeclared/altered cell folds elsewhere
//!     and cannot be pinned (the `mapRoot_injective` no-extra-cells tooth biting in-circuit;
//!     `tests/effect_vm_umem_real_turn.rs::cross_cell_read_whole_image_*`). The cross-table wiring
//!     binding the chip's insert-chain `(key, value)` rows to THIS universal boundary table's
//!     per-domain `(domain, key)` cells is REALIZED (`whole_image_fold::whole_image_fold_bound_*`):
//!     each fold link drives a `UMemOp::Read` against the boundary table, so the deployed
//!     address-closure lookup (`BUS_UMEM_ADDRS`) forces every folded cell DECLARED and the Blum
//!     balance (`BUS_UMEM_CHECK`) forces its folded value to equal the declared cell's value — the
//!     chip folds EXACTLY the declared boundary, no new bus/column/AIR
//!     (`tests/effect_vm_umem_real_turn.rs::whole_image_fold_bound_*`).
//!   * The custom table id 5 (Lean `SUBMASK_TID = 0`) is realized as the bitwise-submask
//!     relation at 30 bits (`subsetTable_mem_iff`: both elements in `[0, 2^30)` and
//!     `keep & held = keep`), enforced by per-bit decomposition — the custom-table CONTENTS
//!     manifest is the named small IR follow-up on the Lean side; until it lands the id ↦
//!     relation binding lives here, in one place.
//!   * The memory boundary image (`minit`/`mfin`/declared addresses) is witness-supplied
//!     (the `MemBoundaryWitness` instance); binding the init image to main-trace state
//!     columns is part of the PI-v3 / witness-restructure ride-along, not this module.
//!   * v1 descriptors (no `"ir"` key) keep proving through `lean_descriptor_air::
//!     prove_vm_descriptor` untouched — both registries live until the flag-day.

//    PROVENANCE (#175): the permutation constraints are `poseidon2_permute_expr`

//    p3-baby-bear `BABYBEAR_POSEIDON2_RC_16` / `..INTERNAL_DIAG_16` tables (descriptor
//    `params` pin those source names; `parse_chip_params` refuses a mismatch), and the
//    permutation FUNCTION is conformance-KAT'd against the pinned-rev plonky3
//    `default_babybear_poseidon2_16()` (`poseidon2::tests::poseidon2_plonky3_cross_check_kat`).
//    The audited `p3-poseidon2-circuit-air` is used where its layout is forced on us —
//    the recursion verifier circuit (`plonky3_recursion_impl.rs`). NOTE: the descriptor
//    param `sbox_registers: 1` describes the p3-air REGISTERED layout, which this chip
//    deliberately does NOT use (measured net-negative, see `max_constraint_degree` +
//    docs/PROOF-ECONOMICS.md §2c); the parameter is a frozen descriptor pin (no regen
