//! The canonical, **openable** heap commitment: a SORTED Poseidon2 binary
//! Merkle map over a cell's `(collection_id, key) → value` entries.
//!
//! ## Why this module exists (REFINEMENT-DESIGN Decision 1 / THE ROTATION)
//!
//! THE HEAP is the generalization of the proven capability root
//! ([`crate::cap_root`]) with a **generic leaf**: where the cap tree stores the
//! 7-field capability leaf keyed by `slot_hash`, the heap tree stores
//! `hash[addr, value]` keyed by `addr = hash[collection_id, key]`. Same sorted
//! discipline, same sentinels, same `hash_fact` nodes, same depth — reuse of
//! verified machinery, not invention.
//!
//! This module is the **single** heap-root scheme, computed byte-identically
//! wherever it runs:
//!
//!   * the executor computes the post-write root here and carries it on the
//!     wire (`FullActionA.heapWriteA`'s `newRoot` / `WireAction::HeapWrite`),
//!     pinned into the `heap_root` register;
//!   * the cell recomputes the same root over its heap entries and refuses a
//!     mismatch (the cap Phase-A discipline);
//!   * the circuit's heap-write descriptor gadget recomputes `addr` and the
//!     leaf **in-row** (`Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/EffectVmEmitHeapRoot.lean`:
//!     `siteHeapAddr` / `siteHeapLeaf` are arity-2 hash sites over exactly
//!     `[coll, key]` and `[addr, value]` — the same images [`heap_addr`] and
//!     [`HeapLeaf::digest`] compute here).
//!
//! The hash shapes are pinned by the Lean model (`Dregg2/Substrate/Heap.lean`
//! `addrOf` / `leafOf`): **arity-2, no domain tag** — the circuit hash sites
//! recompute these exact images, so adding a tag here would fork cell from
//! circuit. The differential test
//! `circuit/tests/heap_root_cell_circuit_differential.rs` pins the scheme
//! against an independently hand-built tree (the A2-gate shape).
//!
//! ## Phase A scope
//!
//! Phase A makes the `heap_root` VALUE this sorted-Merkle root. The per-write
//! root ADVANCE stays pinned-as-digest at the tree layer (the circuit pins the
//! executor's computed new root and recomputes the address + leaf in-row); the
//! genuine in-circuit sorted-tree update/insert gates (membership-open +
//! leaf-update + bracketed sorted-insert, mirroring the revocation circuit)
//! are the Phase-E lane.
