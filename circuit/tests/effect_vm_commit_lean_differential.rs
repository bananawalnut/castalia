//! # THE COMMITMENT-CONSTRUCTION DIFFERENTIAL — deployed Rust `compute_commitment` ⟺ Lean model.
//!
//! ## SCOPE (read first — what this is and is NOT)
//!
//! This is a STRUCTURAL differential on the per-cell COMMITMENT CONSTRUCTION: it checks that the
//! deployed `CellState::compute_commitment` hash-tree (limb order, nesting, binding, non-vacuity)
//! matches an INDEPENDENT re-fold over the Lean `effectVmLimbs` order. The "byte-identical" claims
//! below are byte-identity of the COMMITMENT HASH TREE against that independent Lean-limb re-fold —
//! NOT a serialization round-trip, and NOT executor EVAL AGREEMENT.
//!
//! It is NOT the Lean↔Rust EXECUTOR eval-agreement check. That faithfulness — the verified Lean
//! executor and the deployed Rust circuit/executor computing the SAME post-state on the SAME input —
//! is the CANONICAL denotational differential `ir2_denotational_differential.rs` (descriptor IR-v2
//! denotation `Satisfied2` ⟺ deployed `Ir2Air::eval`) and the turn-side
//! `dregg-turn/tests/lean_state_producer_differential.rs` (full post-state ledger `.root()` agreement
//! on a real turn). This file grounds ONE leg those rely on: that the commitment the post-state root
//! is built from has the proven limb shape. It does not, and does not claim to, witness eval
//! agreement.
//!
//! The closed circuit-soundness crown (`metatheory/Dregg2/Circuit/StateCommit.lean`
//! `lightclient_unfoolable_circuit_sound`) is over the abstract per-cell leaf and the
//! kernel root `recStateCommit`. The DEPLOYED per-cell commitment is
//! `dregg_circuit::CellState::compute_commitment` (`circuit/src/effect_vm/cell_state.rs`):
//! a `hash_4_to_1` tree over the ORDERED limb list
//!
//!   `[balance_lo, balance_hi, nonce, fields[0..8], cap_root, record_digest]`
//!
//! absorbed as
//!
//!   `inter1     = hash_4_to_1(balance_lo, balance_hi, nonce, fields[0])`
//!   `inter2     = hash_4_to_1(fields[1], fields[2], fields[3], fields[4])`
//!   `inter3     = hash_4_to_1(fields[5], fields[6], fields[7], cap_root)`
//!   `commitment = hash_4_to_1(inter1, inter2, inter3, record_digest)`.
//!
//! The Lean faithful model is `Dregg2.Circuit.CommitDifferential.effectVmCommit` over an
//! abstract 4-to-1 compress `h4`; the named field correspondence pins `record_digest` at
//! limb index 12 (`effectVmLimbs` / `record_digest_at_index_12`), exactly the role the Lean
//! `RH`/`systemRootsDigest` rest-hash limb plays. This file is the EMPIRICAL twin that grounds
//! that abstract `h4` in the REAL `dregg_circuit::poseidon2::hash_4_to_1` and the real
//! `dregg_cell::compute_authority_digest_felt`, and CHECKS each structural claim the Lean
//! theorems prove:
//!
//!   1. `differential_limb_order_matches_lean` — the deployed `compute_commitment` is
//!      BYTE-IDENTICAL to an independent re-fold over the Lean `effectVmLimbs` order (the SAME
//!      nesting, the SAME limb positions). The shape MATCHES (no reorder / dropped / extra limb).
//!
//!   2. `differential_record_digest_at_position_12` — the `record_digest` is the FOURTH root
//!      input (the index-12 authority-residue limb), and the real cell's
//!      `compute_authority_digest_felt` is the felt that flows into it — the named field
//!      correspondence, grounded.
//!
//!   3. `differential_record_digest_binds` — the deployed commitment BINDS `record_digest`
//!      (audit P0-2 / Lean `effectVmCommit_binds_record_digest`): two cells differing ONLY in
//!      authority residue commit DIFFERENTLY.
//!
//!   4. `differential_residue_free_noop` — a residue-free cell (`empty_record_digest() = ZERO`)
//!      commits exactly as the legacy ZERO form (Lean `effectVmCommit_residueFree_noop`).
//!
//!   5. `differential_real_cell_authority_residue_flows` — a REAL cell carrying authority state
//!      beyond the welded limbs (permissions / VK / lifecycle) produces a NON-ZERO
//!      `compute_authority_digest_felt`, and seeding it changes the commitment — the deployed
//!      P0-2 closure is non-vacuous on a real cell.
