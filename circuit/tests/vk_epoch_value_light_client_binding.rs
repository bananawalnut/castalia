//! # THE VK-EPOCH LIGHT-CLIENT BINDING BITE — the VALUE family FORCED ON-WIRE.
//!
//! ## What this confirms (audit a6473605 / `docs/SAFELY-LIVE-CHECKLIST.md` line 14;
//! `docs/CIRCUIT-FUNCTIONAL-CORRECTNESS.md` §"The VALUE_MISSING wall")
//!
//! Six VALUE effects move a column the deployed circuit ALREADY binds into the published
//! commitment — `bal` (`transfer` / `mint` (a balance-IN transfer) / `burn` / `bridgeMint`),
//! `field[idx]` (`setField`), and `nonce` (`incrementNonce`). Unlike the permsVK / lifecycle /
//! note / cap-write families (whose write lands OFF a committed column — `params[0]`+`effects_hash`
//! or a side-table with no committed column/systemRoot), the VALUE family's moved column lives in
//! the V1 state block at `STATE_AFTER_BASE + {BALANCE_LO/HI | NONCE | FIELD_BASE+idx}`. That block
//! is absorbed verbatim into the per-cell commitment:
//!
//!   * the V1 GROUP-4 commit (`compute_commitment` = `hash_4_to_1(inter1, inter2, inter3, RH)`,
//!     where `inter1 = hash([bal_lo, bal_hi, nonce, field0])`, …) → `STATE_AFTER + STATE_COMMIT`;
//!   * the rotated AFTER block's welded limbs (`EffectVmEmitRotationV3.weldsAt`:
//!     `r0↔balance_lo`, `r1↔nonce`, `r2↔balance_hi`, `r3..r10↔fields`) — `fill_block` OVERRIDES
//!     them per-row from the V1 state truth and folds them into `AFTER_BASE + B_STATE_COMMIT`,
//!     which is the PUBLISHED `NEW_COMMIT` (PI 43, `dpis[V1_PI_COUNT + 1]`).
//!
//! So a LIGHT CLIENT — with no trusted post-cell, running `prove`/`verify_vm_descriptor2` ALONE —
//! sees the moved column flow into the anchored commitment. The question the FORGE-HUNT answers:
//! is that committed column ALSO bound by a LIVE in-circuit TRANSITION constraint, so a post-state
//! forged to differ ONLY in the moved column is UNSAT? (The cap-write forge taught us that
//! "Class-A in Lean + passes prove-through" does NOT imply the wire binds — a dormant gate leaves
//! the column unconstrained, a SILENT FORGE.)
//!
//! ## The anchor-disabled discriminator (the plan's bar, the guardrail)
//!
//! Both teeth run through `prove_vm_descriptor2` / `verify_vm_descriptor2` ALONE — the exact circuit
//! verify a light client runs, which NEVER calls `apply_effect_to_cell` and NEVER anchors an
//! off-cell record-pin. So a reject here is the IN-CIRCUIT transition gate biting, not host
//! re-derivation.
//!
//!   * POSITIVE (no downgrade): an HONEST turn proves + verifies green.
//!   * NEGATIVE (the forge): a post-state forged to differ ONLY in the moved column — the V1 AFTER
//!     column carries the FORGED value AND every downstream commitment column is recomputed
//!     self-consistently (so the COMMIT-pin/recompose gates are SATISFIED and the published commit
//!     genuinely absorbs the forged value, exactly what a light client would accept on the wire) —
//!     is UNSAT. The SOLE surviving violation is the per-row TRANSITION constraint
//!     (`new = old ±amount` / `field-set` / `nonce-tick`). If ANY of the six ACCEPTS, the moved
//!     column is NOT bound on the wire = a SILENT FORGE in a core value effect (critical).
//!
//! Non-vacuity: each test asserts the forged column differs from the honest one AND that the honest
//! trace proves (so the close is satisfiable, not vacuously UNSAT).
//!
//! Gated on `prover`. Run with
//! `cargo test -p dregg-circuit --features prover vk_epoch_value -- --nocapture`.

// (formerly `#![cfg(feature = "prover")]` — that dregg-circuit feature is GONE; the
// descriptor-level prove/verify (`prove_vm_descriptor2`/`verify_vm_descriptor2`) is
// now unconditional in dregg-circuit, so this test compiles + runs by default.)
