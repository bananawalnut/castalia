//! # THE VK-EPOCH LIGHT-CLIENT BINDING AUDIT — MISC FAMILY (BATCH D).
//!
//! The fourth VK-epoch family: the five MISC effects, audited through the anchor-disabled
//! discriminator (the `prove`/`verify_vm_descriptor2` path ALONE — the same circuit verify a
//! ledgerless client runs; it NEVER calls `apply_effect_to_cell`, so a reject here is the
//! IN-CIRCUIT weld, not the host re-derivation). Mirrors the structure of
//! `circuit/tests/vk_epoch_perms_vk_light_client_binding.rs` (commit d58545a5f).
//!
//! Unlike the perms/VK family — which was ALREADY forced on-wire (the in-circuit `permsVKWeldGate`
//! binds the post perms/vk into the commitment) — the misc family splits into THREE grades, and
//! this audit reports each PRECISELY rather than over-claiming:
//!
//!   * **`emitEvent` / `pipelinedSend` / `exercise` — NO-CELL-WRITE; ON-WIRE BINDING = the
//!     state/commit passthrough, NOT the produced hash.** These write no committed cell column
//!     (full state passthrough; the nonce ticks). The rotated (light-client) descriptor binds the
//!     before/after balance·nonce boundaries and the published OLD/NEW commit·height·caveat — a
//!     forged AFTER state (nonce/balance) is UNSAT. But their DECLARED HASH (topic/payload /
//!     send_hash / exercise_hash) rides the V1 hand-AIR's `compute_effects_hash` PI-equality, whose
//!     PI slots (`EMIT_EVENT_TOPIC_HASH = 174`, …) lie PAST the rotated PI window (`V1_PI_COUNT =
//!     42`) — and the rotated descriptor binds none of `PI[16..20]` (`EFFECTS_HASH`) either. So the
//!     PRODUCED hash is bound at the full node, NOT in the rotated light-client descriptor. This
//!     audit asserts both: (POSITIVE) the state/commit IS bound on-wire; (RESIDUAL) a forged
//!     declared-hash param is ACCEPTED through the rotated path — the effects_hash is not welded
//!     into the light-client commitment. THE NAMED RESIDUAL: lift the effects_hash (or the
//!     emit-event topic/payload PI) into the rotated PI window so the produced output binds on-wire.
//!
//!   * **`makeSovereign` — VALUE_PARTIAL with a BROKEN LIVE SEAM (missing weld).** The registry
//!     descriptor `makeSovereignVmDescriptor2R24` declares 47 PIs (the record-forcing fifth pin),
//!     but the LIVE generator `generate_rotated_effect_vm_trace` emits only 46 dpis: its
//!     `record_pin_offset` (`trace_rotated.rs`) does NOT include `MakeSovereign`, so no PI[46] is
//!     fed. Consequence: an honest makeSovereign turn CANNOT prove through the live path
//!     (`public input count 46 != descriptor public_input_count 47`). The committed AFTER mode limb
//!     (`B_MODE = 35`) and authority-digest limb (`B_AUTHORITY_DIGEST = 24`, which folds the mode
//!     byte) DO move and ARE absorbed into the commit — but the declared record pin is never wired,
//!     so the makeSovereign rotated path is presently UN-PROVABLE, not merely partially-bound. THE
//!     NAMED RESIDUAL (shared-code weld, NOT in this disjoint test file): add the `MakeSovereign`
//!     arm to `record_pin_offset` (→ `Some(B_AUTHORITY_DIGEST)`, or a dedicated `B_MODE` pin) so the
//!     generator feeds the 47th PI the descriptor declares.
//!
//!   * **`setFieldDyn` — the dynamic overflow write PROVES (the residual is CLOSED).** The dynamic
//!     `SetField` (`field_idx > 7`) routes to `setFieldDynVmDescriptor2R24`, a DISTINCT 581-wide
//!     V1Face geometry the standard generator could not produce (it panicked on `field_idx < 8` and
//!     laid the 608-wide host). `generate_rotated_set_field_dyn_base` now builds it from scratch: the
//!     Blum write→read pair (`addr = value = col 69`, `prev_value = col 70`, `prev_serial = col 74`,
//!     `readback = col 75`) over a `MemBoundaryWitness`, the fields-root weld (col 275 == col 68), and
//!     the fifth pin (col 263 → PI[46]). The honest dynamic write PROVES + light-client VERIFIES; a
//!     forged read-back is REJECTED.
//!
//! Each test below is GREEN: the confirmable bindings (the no-cell-write state/commit) prove + the
//! discriminator bites; the residuals are asserted as residuals (the precise broken seam / the
//! accepted forge), NOT faked green.
//!
//! Gated on `prover`. Run with
//! `cargo test -p dregg-circuit --features prover --test vk_epoch_misc_light_client_binding -- --nocapture`.

// (formerly `#![cfg(feature = "prover")]` — that dregg-circuit feature is GONE; the
// descriptor-level prove/verify (`prove_vm_descriptor2`/`verify_vm_descriptor2`) is
// now unconditional in dregg-circuit, so this test compiles + runs by default.)

//
// HISTORY (the residual that this test now CLOSES): the dynamic `SetField` (`field_idx >= 8`) routes
// to `setFieldDynVmDescriptor2R24`, a DISTINCT 581-wide V1Face geometry the standard
// `generate_rotated_effect_vm_trace` could not produce — it (a) hard-panicked on the v1
// `field_idx < 8` assert and (b) laid the standard 608-wide host (40 chip sites), while setFieldDyn's
// face carries four FEWER chip sites (581 = 328 ungraduated + 7·36 + 1 reserved). So the dynamic
// overflow SetField was UNREACHABLE: its declared fields-root weld + Blum write→read pair were
// exercised by no live path.
//
// `generate_rotated_set_field_dyn_base` now builds the geometry from scratch: the Blum linear-memory
// write+read pair (`addr = value = col 69`, `prev_value = col 70`, `prev_serial = col 74`,
// `readback = col 75`) over a `MemBoundaryWitness`, the fields-root weld (gate 31: col 275 == col 68),
// and the fifth pin (col 263 → PI[46]). An honest dynamic SetField now PROVES + light-client VERIFIES.
// ============================================================================

/// **setFieldDyn — the dynamic overflow `SetField` PROVES against its deployed 581-wide descriptor
/// (the missing-generator residual is CLOSED), and a forged readback is REJECTED.**
///
/// BEFORE: the live generator panicked on `field_idx >= 8` and produced only the 328/608-wide standard
/// geometry — the 581-wide setFieldDyn descriptor was unprovable, so the effect did not exist in the
/// living protocol. AFTER: `generate_rotated_set_field_dyn_base` builds the 581-wide V1Face geometry
/// with the Blum write→read transport; the honest dynamic-field write PROVES + VERIFIES. The FORGE
/// pole holds: a tampered read-back column (the read no longer transports the write's value) has no
/// satisfying memory replay and is REJECTED.
