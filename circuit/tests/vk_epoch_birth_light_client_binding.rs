//! # THE VK-EPOCH BIRTH-FAMILY LIGHT-CLIENT BINDING BITE — createCell / factory / spawn FORCED ON-WIRE.
//!
//! ## What this closes (`docs/VK-EPOCH-PLAN.md`, STAGE B / Family A — the BIRTH family)
//!
//! Family 1 (`vk_epoch_perms_vk_light_client_binding.rs`, commit d58545a5f) proved setPermissions /
//! setVK are FORCED-ON-WIRE via an in-circuit DIGEST-LIMB WELD (`permsVKWeldGate`: committed AFTER
//! perms/vk sub-limb == declared `param0`). The BIRTH family — createCell, createCellFromFactory,
//! spawn — rides a DIFFERENT (and stronger) in-circuit primitive: the ACCOUNTS-SET GROW-GATE on the
//! rotated `cells_root` limb (limb 0), the deployment-real sibling of the noteSpend nullifier
//! grow-gate. It is NOT a single-felt weld; it is a sorted-Poseidon2 MAP-OP pair the live
//! `{createCell,factory,spawn}VmDescriptor2R24` carry (`EffectVmEmitRotationV3.{createCellV3,
//! factoryV3,spawnV3}`):
//!
//!   * `cellsFreshOp` (`.absent`) — the new-cell key is a NON-MEMBER of the BEFORE accounts tree
//!     (no id collision);
//!   * `cellsInsertOp` (`.insert`) — the AFTER `cells_root` IS the GENUINE sorted insert of the
//!     new-cell key into the BEFORE accounts tree.
//!
//! The AFTER `cells_root` limb (limb 0) is ABSORBED by `wireCommitR` into the published
//! `B_STATE_COMMIT` carrier → the rotated `NEW_COMMIT` anchor (PI 43). So the binding chain a LIGHT
//! CLIENT verifies, with NO trusted post-cell, is:
//!
//!     NEW_COMMIT (PI 43, the claimed rotated NEW commit)  ⟹  B_STATE_COMMIT carrier
//!       ⟹  AFTER cells_root limb (absorbed)  ⟹  (`.insert` map-op) == insert(BEFORE cells_root, key)
//!       ⟹  (`.absent` map-op) key ∉ BEFORE  ⟹  key == PI 46 (the new-cell-key pin, == effect param)
//!
//! A forged post-state — a turn that CLAIMS a cell was born but whose AFTER accounts root is NOT the
//! genuine sorted insert (a fabricated root, or a FROZEN root with no growth) — absorbs a `cells_root`
//! the `.insert` op cannot witness, so `prove_vm_descriptor2` has no satisfying assignment → UNSAT.
//! The map-op threads the BEFORE accounts leaf-set as the single `map_heaps` entry; it is the SAME
//! sorted-Poseidon2 set-membership the circuit already enforces for noteSpend.
//!
//! ## The light-client discriminator (the plan's bar, §6 / the guardrail)
//!
//! Both teeth run through `prove_vm_descriptor2` / `verify_vm_descriptor2` ALONE — the same circuit
//! verify a light client runs (`sdk::full_turn_proof::verify_effect_vm_rotated_with_cutover`, which
//! NEVER calls `apply_effect_to_cell`). So this is INHERENTLY the anchor-disabled discriminator: a
//! reject here is the IN-CIRCUIT grow-gate biting, NOT the host re-derivation.
//!
//!   * POSITIVE (no downgrade): an HONEST createCell / factory / spawn turn over a GENUINE grown
//!     accounts-set proves + verifies.
//!   * NEGATIVE (the bite), two poles per effect:
//!       - FORGED after-root: the AFTER `cells_root` is bumped to a set the kernel never grew (the
//!         dependent commit + NEW_COMMIT PI recomputed self-consistently) — UNSAT (the `.insert` op
//!         pins the after-root to the genuine insert);
//!       - FROZEN after-root: the AFTER `cells_root` EQUALS the BEFORE (no growth — the pre-grow-gate
//!         shape) — UNSAT (the `.insert` op forces `after = insert(before, key) ≠ before`).
//!
//! Unlike family-2 (refusal/lifecycle PAYLOAD), there is NO off-cell-anchor residual here: the
//! grow-gate is genuinely in-circuit, so all three birth effects are LIGHT-CLIENT FORCED-ON-WIRE.
//!
//! Gated on `prover` (compiles `descriptor_ir2`). Run with
//! `cargo test -p dregg-circuit --features prover --test vk_epoch_birth_light_client_binding -- --nocapture`.

// (formerly `#![cfg(feature = "prover")]` — that dregg-circuit feature is GONE; the
// descriptor-level prove/verify (`prove_vm_descriptor2`/`verify_vm_descriptor2`) is
// now unconditional in dregg-circuit, so this test compiles + runs by default.)
