//! # THE TURN-IDENTITY WELD (#225) — the LEDGERLESS LIGHT CLIENT'S forcing tooth.
//!
//! The Lean keystone `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.CapOpenTurnPins.effCapOpenV3TB` (descriptor
//! `transferCapOpenTBVmDescriptor2R24`, trace_width 409, public_input_count 49) is the LIVE transfer
//! cap-open PLUS two turn-identity columns (`actor`/`dst`) and three appended `.piBinding .last` gates
//! welding the cap-open `src`/`actor`/`dst` columns to NEW public-input slots (`src → PI[46]`, `actor →
//! PI[47]`, `dst → PI[48]`). The verifier ANCHORS those three PIs to the TRUSTED turn it holds
//! (`anchor_cap_open_turn_pins`, the deployment realization of the named `TurnIdentityAnchored`
//! predicate), exactly as the record-pin family anchors `dpis[46]` from the trusted post-cell.
//!
//! THE FORCING (the light-client-relevant tooth): a ledgerless light client, holding only the trusted
//! turn, can conclude the published turn's `actor`/`src`/`dst` MATCH the proven transition. This test
//! realizes that END-TO-END in Rust:
//!
//!   * an HONEST transfer TB cap-open proof verifies when the verifier anchors the three turn-identity
//!     PIs to the SAME `(src, actor, dst)` the prover published;
//!   * a proof whose published `actor`/`src`/`dst` PI does NOT match the trusted turn is REJECTED by
//!     `verify_vm_descriptor2` ALONE (the verifier overrides the PI from the trusted turn; the appended
//!     `.piBinding` gate then disagrees with the proof's bound, last-row-pinned column → UNSAT).
//!
//! This is `CapOpenTurnPins.effCapOpenV3TB_rejects_mismatched_src` made good on the deployed prover +
//! verifier: the gate is LOAD-BEARING for a ledgerless client.
//!
//! LAW #1: this test fills COLUMNS only; every constraint is the Lean-declared chip lookup / base gate
//! / pi_binding the IR-v2 interpreter realizes generically. No hand-authored Rust constraint semantics.
//!
//! Gated on `prover`. Run with
//! `cargo test -p dregg-circuit --features prover cap_open_turn_bound -- --nocapture`.

// (formerly `#![cfg(feature = "prover")]` — that dregg-circuit feature is GONE; the
// descriptor-level prove/verify (`prove_vm_descriptor2`/`verify_vm_descriptor2`) is
// now unconditional in dregg-circuit, so this test compiles + runs by default.)
