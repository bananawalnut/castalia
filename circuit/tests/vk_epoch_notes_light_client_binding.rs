//! # THE VK-EPOCH LIGHT-CLIENT BINDING BITE — noteSpend / noteCreate FORCED ON-WIRE.
//!
//! ## What this closes (`docs/VK-EPOCH-PLAN.md`, the notes family — #13 noteCreate, #14 noteSpend)
//!
//! noteSpend is the GOLD-STANDARD in-circuit gate of the whole effect vocabulary: its nullifier
//! accumulator lives on a ROTATED limb (`B_NULLIFIER_ROOT = 26`), witness-carried, and the live
//! `noteSpendVmDescriptor2R24` descriptor carries TWO selector-gated map-ops —
//! `nullifierFreshOp` (`.absent`: the spent nullifier is a NON-MEMBER of the BEFORE nullifier tree
//! — the in-circuit double-spend tooth) and `nullifierInsertOp` (`.write`: the AFTER root IS the
//! genuine sorted-Poseidon2 insert of the spent nullifier). noteCreate is the append-only twin on
//! the `commitments_root` limb (`B_COMMITMENTS_ROOT = 27`), carrying `commitmentsInsertOp`
//! (`.insert`: the AFTER commitments root IS the genuine sorted insert of the published note
//! commitment).
//!
//! Unlike the perms/VK weld (which forces an AFTER digest limb EQUAL to a *declared param*), the
//! notes-family forcing is a MAP-OP GROW-GATE: the map-op pins
//!
//!     AFTER root  ==  op(BEFORE root, key)        (op ∈ {`.write`, `.insert`})
//!
//! against a real sorted-Poseidon2 tree threaded as the prover's `map_heaps` witness. The overridden
//! AFTER root is in turn absorbed by `recompute_block_commit` into each block's `B_STATE_COMMIT`
//! carrier → the published rotated OLD/NEW commit PIs (`V1_PI_COUNT`, `V1_PI_COUNT + 1`). So the
//! binding chain a LIGHT CLIENT verifies, with NO trusted post-cell, is:
//!
//!     NEW_COMMIT (claimed, PI-anchored)  ⟹  B_STATE_COMMIT carrier
//!       ⟹  AFTER nullifier/commitments-root limb (absorbed)
//!       ⟹  (map-op `.write`/`.insert`)  AFTER == op(BEFORE, key)  ⟹  the genuine grown set
//!
//! A post-state forged to differ ONLY in the nullifier-root / commitments-root — a root the kernel
//! never genuinely grew — is NOT the sorted insert of the published key, so the `.write`/`.insert`
//! op has NO membership/update witness and `prove_vm_descriptor2` REFUSES it (or the absorbed-commit
//! mismatch reds `verify_vm_descriptor2`). The forge is rejected by the IN-CIRCUIT grow-gate, NOT a
//! host re-derivation.
//!
//! ## The light-client discriminator (the plan's bar, §6 / the guardrail)
//!
//! Both teeth run through `prove_vm_descriptor2` / `verify_vm_descriptor2` ALONE — the exact circuit
//! verify a light client runs. That path NEVER calls `apply_effect_to_cell` and NEVER anchors an
//! off-cell record-pin PI, so these tests are INHERENTLY the *anchor-disabled* discriminator: a
//! reject here is the in-circuit grow-gate biting, not a full-node host re-derivation.
//!
//!   * POSITIVE (no downgrade): an HONEST noteSpend / noteCreate turn proves + verifies green.
//!   * NEGATIVE (the bite): a post-state forged to differ ONLY in the nullifier-root /
//!     commitments-root — a root the kernel never grew — is UNSAT.
//!
//! Gated on `prover` (compiles `descriptor_ir2`). Run with
//! `cargo test -p dregg-circuit --features prover --test vk_epoch_notes_light_client_binding -- --nocapture`.

// (formerly `#![cfg(feature = "prover")]` — that dregg-circuit feature is GONE; the
// descriptor-level prove/verify (`prove_vm_descriptor2`/`verify_vm_descriptor2`) is
// now unconditional in dregg-circuit, so this test compiles + runs by default.)
