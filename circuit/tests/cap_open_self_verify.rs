//! # THE IN-CIRCUIT CAP-MEMBERSHIP OPEN — self-verifies END-TO-END through `prove_vm_descriptor2`.
//!
//! The Lean keystone `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.CapOpenEmit.attenuateCapOpenEffV3` (descriptor
//! `dregg-effectvm-attenuateA-v1-rot24-v3-capopen-eff`, trace_width CAP_OPEN_WIDTH = rotated + cap-open
//! appendix) PROVES that a `DeployedCapOpen.Satisfied` cap-membership row opens the deployed
//! depth-16 cap-tree at a write-mask leaf whose target is the turn's `src`. This test realizes
//! that descriptor in Rust on a REAL witness: it builds a genuine rotated AttenuateCapability
//! base trace (the proven 311-wide attenuate path), widens it to 369 with the cap-open appendix
//! filled by `widen_to_cap_open` (genuine `cap_chip_absorb` leaf + node digests — the SINGLE
//! in-circuit chip hash the cap-tree commits to), and PROVES through `prove_vm_descriptor2`. The
//! proof self-verifies before returning, so a green test == the cap-open chip-lookups + base gates
//! are exercised end-to-end against the IR-v2 interpreter's auto-gathered chip table.
//!
//! LAW #1: this test fills COLUMNS only; every constraint is the Lean-declared chip lookup /
//! base gate the IR-v2 interpreter realizes generically. No hand-authored Rust constraint
//! semantics.
//!
//! Gated on `prover`. Run with
//! `cargo test -p dregg-circuit --features prover cap_open_attenuate_self_verifies -- --nocapture`.

// (formerly `#![cfg(feature = "prover")]` — that dregg-circuit feature is GONE; the
// descriptor-level prove/verify (`prove_vm_descriptor2`/`verify_vm_descriptor2`) is
// now unconditional in dregg-circuit, so this test compiles + runs by default.)
