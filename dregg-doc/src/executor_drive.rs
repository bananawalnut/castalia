//! **THE EXECUTOR-DRIVE SEAM CLOSED — a document edit runs through the genuine
//! [`dregg_turn::TurnExecutor`], so it is cap-gated, finalized, and journaled.**
//! (DOCUMENT-LANGUAGE.md §3.3 per-region edit caps, §4.3 dregg-native.)
//!
//! [`crate::doccell::DocCell::edit`] desugars an [`Op`] to genuine
//! [`Effect::SetField`] writes and assembles the [`TurnReceipt`] *directly* — so
//! it bypasses the executor's permission gate, capability consumption, and the
//! `LedgerJournal`. That is the self-sovereign authoring path (the receipt's
//! `finality` is honestly `Tentative`). This module closes that seam: an edit
//! is built into a real [`dregg_turn::Turn`] and run through
//! [`TurnExecutor::execute`], the **sole entry point for ledger state
//! mutations**. The edit therefore goes through the *real* spine:
//!
//! - **Cap-gated.** The author is a distinct *editor cell*; the document is a
//!   separate *region cell*. A `SetField` whose target (the region cell) is not
//!   the actor (the editor) triggers the executor's
//!   [`check_cross_cell_permission`] gate — the editor must hold a c-list
//!   capability to the region cell, or the effect is **refused in-band** with
//!   [`TurnError::CapabilityNotHeld`] (NOT a panic). This is the seam where
//!   per-region edit caps (DOCUMENT-LANGUAGE §3.3's `{view, comment, edit,
//!   admin}`) become enforceable: an editor that lacks the region cap cannot
//!   edit that region.
//! - **Finalized.** The executor's single-node commit path produces a receipt
//!   with [`Finality::Final`] (NOT `Tentative`) — driving through the real
//!   executor *is* the finality upgrade.
//! - **Journaled.** The executor walks its `LedgerJournal` (rollback on any
//!   effect failure), meters computrons, advances the agent's nonce and
//!   receipt-chain head — the full `simulate → commit` spine, not a hand-rolled
//!   receipt.
//!
//! ## The projection: the document rides the cell's committed `fields_map`
//!
//! The executor's `apply_set_field` heap arm writes `set_field_ext(key)` for any
//! `key >= STATE_SLOTS` — the cell's committed overflow map (`fields_map`,
//! digested into `fields_root`, which the canonical state commitment absorbs).
//! So the executor-driven projection lays the document's atoms / edges / fields
//! into that map under a flat key
//! [`field_key`]` = STATE_SLOTS + ((collection as u64) << 32) | (key as u64)`.
//! Distinct `(collection, key)` heap addresses get distinct field keys (the same
//! injective scheme [`crate::project_graph`] uses, lifted past the 16 fixed
//! register slots), so the document commitment is the genuine `fields_root` the
//! executor writes — a light client trusts the same root the executor moves.
//!
//! ## What remains (the federation/finality tail, named honestly)
//!
//! The executor commits on a *single node* (`Finality::Final` is the solo-mode
//! commit). True BFT quorum / federation finality (multiple nodes validating the
//! same turn, a quorum certificate) is the node-layer's job and is NOT exercised
//! here — `dregg-doc` drives the executor, not a federation. The receipt is a
//! genuine finalized single-node receipt; the cross-node quorum is the remaining
//! tail.
