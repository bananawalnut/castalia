//! The `dregg://` web of cells — a link is a capability, a fetch is a verified
//! attested cross-cell read.
//!
//! `docs/desktop-os-research/DISTRIBUTED-SERVO-FACETS.md` Facet 1, in one
//! paragraph: the open web's link is a **location** (`https://host/path`) — you
//! trust DNS to find the host, TLS to authenticate the host, and then you trust
//! *whatever bytes the host hands back*. A `dregg://<cell>` link is not a location
//! but a **capability into a specific cell**; resolving it is not "GET the path"
//! but a **verified cross-cell read** that returns **attested content** — the
//! bytes are content-addressed (`content_hash == blake3(bytes)`) AND accompanied
//! by a receipt + a quorum-signed [`dregg_types::AttestedRoot`] the client checks.
//! So you verify *the page is the page the origin committed* — third-party-
//! checkable, from any source — not "the bytes a TLS-authenticated server chose to
//! send this time."
//!
//! ## What is real here
//!
//! - The fetch reads the served bytes' **content commitment out of the surface
//!   cell's real state** (slot 0 of the [`dregg_cell::Cell`] in a real
//!   [`dregg_cell::Ledger`]) — a genuine cell read, not a mock GET. The cell IS
//!   the origin; its committed `content_hash` is what binds the bytes.
//! - The attestation is the **genuine** [`dregg_types::AttestedRoot`] +
//!   [`dregg_types::merkle_root_of_receipt_hashes`]: the serve leaves a receipt,
//!   the receipt hashes into the federation's receipt-stream Merkle root, and the
//!   client verifies via the REAL [`AttestedRoot::verify_receipt_stream`]. We
//!   build NO bespoke attestation.
//! - The **trusted-path origin chrome** ([`OriginChrome`]) is derived from the
//!   LEDGER (the cell id + its committed URL + its rights lineage), never from the
//!   fetched content — dregg's structural answer to browser-chrome phishing
//!   (`DISTRIBUTED-SERVO-FACETS.md §1.3`).
//!
//! ## The seam to the full executor turn
//!
//! `DISTRIBUTED-SERVO-FACETS.md §2.2`: for the attestation to bind, the origin
//! cell's serve-turn must write the content hash into committed state — a
//! cell-program convention (the `ServedResourceCell` template). Here the serve is
//! modeled as a verified cell-read against a real ledger whose surface cell
//! carries that commitment in slot 0; wiring the serve as a full `Effect`-bearing
//! `TurnExecutor` turn (so the receipt is the executor's own, chained on the
//! per-agent receipt chain) is the named follow-up reported in the BUILD STATUS
//! note. The verification chain (content → commitment → receipt → receipt-stream
//! root → quorum-signed AttestedRoot) is the genuine shape either way.
