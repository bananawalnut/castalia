//! THE LIGHT CLIENT IN THE TAB (N12) — `#[wasm_bindgen]` over
//! `dregg-lightclient::verify_history`.
//!
//! `docs/design-frontiers/WEB-FORWARD.md §8 S4`. The anti-pale-ghost tooth: a
//! browser can fold a whole finalized history into ONE succinct recursive
//! aggregate and verify it RE-WITNESSING NOTHING — the executable counterpart of
//! `Dregg2.Circuit.RecursiveAggregation.light_client_verifies_whole_history`.
//!
//! Four entry points, all honest about the VK trust anchor:
//!
//! - [`light_client_demo`] — fold a real K-turn chain IN THE TAB (each turn's
//!   post-state is the next's pre-state; each leaf is a REAL Lean-descriptor
//!   EffectVM proof verified in-circuit) and light-verify it. This is the SETUP
//!   side that SELF-ANCHORS (the VK fingerprint is minted from the locally
//!   produced fold — exactly how an honest setup mints the anchor it then
//!   distributes). It proves the whole pipeline runs in wasm32; "verify the whole
//!   history yourself" becomes tactile.
//! - [`genesis_vk_anchor`] — return the CONFIG anchor (the root-circuit VK
//!   fingerprint, hex) for a given window shape. This models the anchor a
//!   genesis/checkpoint configuration distributes — the trust input a verifier
//!   holds SEPARATELY from any artifact. (It is minted here from a local honest
//!   fold of that shape, exactly how a setup party mints the anchor it ships.)
//! - [`verify_history_against_anchor`] — the CONFIG-NOT-ARTIFACT tooth made
//!   tactile: fold a real chain, then run the REAL [`dregg_lightclient::verify_history`]
//!   against a VK anchor SUPPLIED BY THE CALLER (the config), NOT self-anchored
//!   from `agg.root_vk_fingerprint()`. A correct config anchor attests; a tampered
//!   anchor is REFUSED with the genuine `VkFingerprintMismatch` — "you did not
//!   trust the server, you CHECKED it against your own configured anchor."
//! - [`produce_external_history_envelope`] — the PRODUCER: fold a real chain and
//!   emit the [`ExternalHistoryEnvelope`] JSON with `proof_bytes_b64` populated
//!   from the proof's versioned byte envelope
//!   ([`dregg_circuit_prove::ivc_turn_chain::WholeChainProofBytes`]). The whole
//!   round-trip (fold → serialize → bytes → deserialize → verify) runs in-tab.
//! - [`verify_devnet_history`] — verify an EXTERNALLY-produced aggregate
//!   (a versioned envelope of proof bytes + carried publics) against a
//!   CONFIG-pinned VK anchor (the anchor a SEPARATE argument, NEVER read off the
//!   envelope under verification — the light-client invariant). The byte-verify
//!   path is CLOSED: this entry base64-decodes `proof_bytes`, decodes the byte
//!   envelope, and runs the REAL recursion verify over the wire (the three teeth)
//!   via [`dregg_lightclient::verify_history_bytes`], re-witnessing nothing.
//!
//! HONEST SCOPE (the project law): this carries the light client's NAMED floor —
//! `recursive_sound` (the recursion fork's FRI engine soundness) — surfaced in the
//! UI, NOT hidden. The verification IS the trust: IF the aggregate verifies (engine
//! sound), THEN the whole history is attested.

// THE PER-SLOT HEAP OPENING — close the served-plain seam.
//
// `verify_devnet_history` attests that a cell's whole finalized history folds to
// its committed state anchor (`final_root`), re-witnessing nothing. But the card a
// trustless portal serves paints per-FIELD values, and those values are the
// SERVER'S rendering until each is bound, in the tab, to the committed cell state.
//
// This is that binding: a per-slot sparse-Merkle OPENING of (slot → value) against
// the cell's committed umem heap root, verified tab-side. It reproduces EXACTLY the
// path fold `dregg_circuit::heap_root` commits with (the arity-2 Poseidon2 leaf
// `hash[heap_addr(coll,key), value]` folded up a depth-`HEAP_TREE_DEPTH` tree by
// `hash_fact`) — the executable counterpart of Lean's `Heap.root_binds_get` (equal
// roots ⇒ equal value at every (coll, key)). A correct opening attests the field
// value; a tampered value, a wrong slot, or a forged path moves the recomputed root
// off `root` and is REFUSED.
//
// HONEST SCOPE: this verifies a field value against the cell's HEAP ROOT. The heap
// root is one limb of the cell-state commitment that the faithful 8-felt
// `final_root` folds — so it BINDS to the light-client-verified anchor, but
// re-deriving `final_root` from the heap root in-tab (recomputing the whole
// cell-state commitment from its limbs) is a further rung, not done here. What IS
// closed: each shown field value provably equals the value committed at its slot in
// the cell heap whose root is the verified opening's `root`.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
