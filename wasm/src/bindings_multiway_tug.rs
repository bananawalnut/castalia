//! **MULTIWAY-TUG, PROVED IN THE BROWSER TAB** — a private match's play proofs
//! generated ON-DEVICE (compiled to wasm32, runnable in a browser). The "moves never
//! leave the device" endgame for the verified card game: the owner's hidden hand is
//! committed as a Poseidon2 4-ary Merkle root, and the *proof that a played card was a
//! legal member of that hand* is minted in the tab — the rest of the hand (the private
//! openings) never crosses the wasm boundary.
//!
//! This module consumes [`dregg_multiway_tug`]'s COMMITTED fold READ-ONLY (it does not
//! modify the game / circuit / fold). Two entry points, at two honest resolutions:
//!
//! ## The reduced, definitely-in-wasm path — [`prove_tug_play_on_device`]
//!
//! `proveTugPlayOnDevice(handJson, cardId)` takes a played private match's hand + the
//! played card and generates, IN WASM, the **per-play membership STARK** — a real
//! arity-4 Poseidon2 Merkle-membership `Ir2BatchProof` that the played card's blinded
//! leaf climbs the committed authentication path to the hand root. It is the SAME
//! base-layer tooth the Phase-3 fold lowers per turn ([`fold::membership_leaf_for_play`]),
//! proven at the base IR-v2 layer (`prove_vm_descriptor2`) and self-verified
//! (`verify_vm_descriptor2`) before it returns. The `root` public input the proof binds
//! is asserted EQUAL to [`HandTree::root`] — the on-device proof commits to the game's
//! REAL committed hand, not a re-derived shape. This is the base STARK the existing
//! shipped `generate_demo_stark_proof` binding already proves runs in wasm; here it is
//! specialized to multiway-tug's own private hand.
//!
//! This is the DRIVEN on-device gate: it builds for wasm32, runs in the tab, and its
//! proof verifies through the SAME migrated consumer contract (`ir2_verify_membership_envelope`)
//! the light client's membership arm uses.
//!
//! ## The full recursive fold — [`fold_tug_match_on_device`]
//!
//! `foldTugMatchOnDevice(handJson, cardA, cardB)` runs the WHOLE Phase-3 fold
//! ([`fold::fold_match`]): two membership-proven plays fold via the deployed per-turn
//! recursion (`prove_turn_chain_recursive`) into ONE `WholeChainProof` a pure light
//! client (`verify_history`) accepts, returning the verify-sufficient
//! [`WholeChainProof::to_bytes`] envelope. It COMPILES for wasm32 (the recursion tower is
//! already in this graph via the light-client-in-the-tab binding), but the RUN is the
//! honest boundary: the plonky3 recursion fold is minutes-to-hours and heavy on RAM even
//! natively, and wasm32 is single-threaded (no rayon) in a 32-bit (≤4 GiB) address space.
//! The measured limit is reported alongside this deliverable — the reduced play path is
//! what proves on-device NOW; the full fold in wasm is bounded by memory + single-thread
//! time (and GPU acceleration / true crypto-ZK are separate, later frontiers).
