//! umem: THE EXECUTOR-STATE BRIDGE — the live executor's state as a view of the ONE
//! universal map, and the live executor's turn as a Blum memory-op trace.
//!
//! The universal-map rotation's long pole (`docs/UNIVERSAL-MAP-ROTATION.md` §2.3/§3:
//! "the 3-verb executor-state bridge: RecordKernelState → the ONE map"). This module is
//! the Rust half of the bridge whose Lean keystone is
//! `metatheory/Dregg2/Exec/UniversalBridge.lean` (`uproj` + the three
//! `*_is_memory_program` agreement theorems):
//!
//!  1. **THE PROJECTION** ([`project_executor_state`] / [`project_ledger`]): every cell
//!     field and executor side-table entry lands at a `(domain, collection, key) ↦ value`
//!     cell of the unified address space — the same five domains as
//!     `Dregg2/Crypto/UniversalMemory.lean`'s `Domain` enum (registers · heap · caps ·
//!     nullifiers · index), with the same wire codes as `DescriptorIR2.domainCode`.
//!
//!  2. **THE TRACE EMITTER** ([`emit_trace`]): for a turn executed by the live executor,
//!     the journal (the undo log that already records every forest mutation with its
//!     prior value, in execution order) is re-read as the turn's Blum WRITE trace —
//!     per-op `(kind, addr, val, prev_val, prev_serial)` rows under the memcheck
//!     discipline (`Dregg2/Crypto/MemoryChecking.lean`). The fold of the emitted trace
//!     over the pre-state projection MUST equal the post-state projection
//!     ([`fold`] — checked eagerly; the executable shadow of the Lean agreement
//!     theorems), and every journal-recorded prior value is cross-checked against the
//!     running fold (drift between the journal and the projection refuses loudly).
//!
//! Wiring: recursion-gated, exactly like the umem circuit leg — the witness is produced
//! only when `TurnExecutor::umem_witness_enabled` is set; the live proving path is
//! untouched (v1 stays the only prover on the wire).
//!

//!    `Field` plane).
//!  * `CellState.heap_root` — NOT projected: the DERIVED commitment (boundary) of the
//!    `Heap` plane, exactly as `fields_root` is of `Field`. The sorted-Poseidon2 root
//!    over the projected `Heap` cells equals it (`boundary_root_derived`); projecting it
//!    would double-count the heap. The committed boundary is still on the cell, and a
//!    cross-cell read binds it directly ([`open_heap_against_committed`]).
//!  * the ledger Merkle tree / root — NOT projected: derived commitment over the cells.
//!  * rate-limit counters / budget gate — NOT projected: per-window executor metering,
//!    not consensus state (they never enter the state commitment).
//!  * the receipt log — owned by the node's MMR lane, not the executor; [`receipt_op`]
//!    lets the caller append the index-domain write when composing a whole-turn witness
//!    (the Lean side carries it as `RecChainedState.log`; adapter (b)
//!    `index_boundary_mroot_derived` covers its boundary commitment).

// THE UMEM BOUNDARY PRODUCER — `UmemTurnWitness` → a REAL `UMemBoundaryWitness`.
//
// The deployed-plumbing piece that lets the SDK/IVC prover be handed a REAL (non-`default`)
// universal-memory boundary witness. Until now the `UmemTurnWitness → UMemBoundaryWitness`
// lowering lived only as test-local helpers (`circuit/tests/effect_vm_umem_real_turn.rs`'s
// `lower`, `effect_vm_umem_cohort.rs`'s `build_umem_form`); this is the library function the
// rotation-flip's Rank 4 routes the deployed prover through (the prover-switch is the NEXT
// sequenced, gated step — this producer is VK-risk-free in isolation).
//
// The lowering uses the deployed Rank-1 address/value CODECS (`heap_addr` for the heap/field
// planes, `slot_hash` for the caps plane, `fold_bytes32`/`fold_bytes` for nullifiers and
// structured values — `metatheory/Dregg2/Crypto/UMemCodec.lean`, `a2217919`), so the produced
// boundary carries REAL structured `(domain, key)` addresses and value felts (not the
// per-proof dense relabeling). The `(domain, key)` address is the literal pair — the domain is
// its own bus coordinate (`UMemOpSpec.domain`), so the in-domain key carries `hash[coll, key]`.
//
// The producer reads the turn's Blum WRITE trace (`UmemTurnWitness::ops`) as the per-op main
// rows and the turn's PRE projection (`UmemTurnWitness::pre`) as the per-domain boundary's init
// image — exactly the triple `prove_vm_descriptor2_umem` consumes. The fold square
// (`fold(pre, ops) == post`) and the memcheck discipline the executor already guarantees carry
// straight into the multiset balance: each address's init is emitted once by the boundary at
// serial 0, every op claims either that init (`prev_serial == 0`) or a prior op's installed
// value, and the codec is a deterministic function so equal values encode to equal felts.

// ===========================================================================
// THE REIFY DIRECTION — the inverse of `project_cell` / `project_ledger`.
//
// `reify_cell` materializes one cell's projected planes back into a live
// `Cell`, RE-DERIVING the deliberately-dropped commitments from the kept
// planes (it does not store them): the user-field-map root (`fields_root`,
// re-derived from the `Field { slot ≥ 16 }` plane), the heap root, the leaf
// caches, and — at the ledger level — the Merkle tree/root (which `Ledger`
// already rebuilds lazily on demand). This closes the time-travel `reify_seam`
// (`turn/tests/umem_time_travel.rs`): a witnessed `UProjection` boundary lifts
// back to a byte-identical `Ledger`.
//
// ## The round-trip law and its faithful class
//
// `reify_ledger(project_ledger(L)) == L` holds for every cell whose state is
// expressible by the projection address space — the FAITHFUL CLASS. The
// projection is value-lossless over that class, and `reify` re-derives the rest.
//
// ## The named residual (the planes the projection does NOT carry — honest)
//
// `project_cell` is injective on the value planes it carries, but it does NOT
// emit a `UKey` for three cell sub-states. A cell that exercises one of these
// carries state the boundary cannot reconstruct, so `reify_cell` REFUSES with a
// precise [`ReifyError`] rather than silently round-tripping a lie:
//
//  1. **`Cell.interfaces`** — the exposed typed-interface vector. No `UKey`
//     plane carries it. ⇒ [`ReifyError::InterfacesNotProjected`].
//
// **Closed (UMEM-PRIMITIVE §2, Stage A): `CellState.heap_map`.** The per-cell
// heap is now a first-class umem plane — every `(collection, key) → value` entry
// projects to a `Heap{cell, collection, key}` cell, so `reify_cell` rebuilds the
// `heap_map` from that preimage and RE-DERIVES `heap_root` (the boundary). A
// non-empty heap is now in the faithful class; `HeapNotProjected` survives only
// for an internally-inconsistent projection (committed boundary ≠ re-derived).
//
// **Closed (reify residuals #3/#4): `CapabilitySet.tombstones` +
// `next_slot`.** A revoke drops the cap from the `CapSlot` plane AND emits one
// `CapTombstone{cell, slot}` ghost (`project_cell`), so BOTH planes carry the
// full c-list shape. `reify_cell` reads the live caps AND the tombstone ghosts
// and hands them to `CapabilitySet::reconstruct`, which restores the
// NON-CONTIGUOUS live slots and re-derives `next_slot = max(live, tombstoned) +
// 1` — so a REVOKED cell round-trips byte-identically (matching the boundary
// the `CapTombstone` plane already proves via `record_kernel_boundary_agrees`).
// `CapTombstonesNotProjected` / `CapNextSlotUnrecoverable` are retained as
// precise diagnostics but are no longer reachable for a revoked cell.
//
// The faithful class is exactly the cells with no interfaces (any heap, any cap
// revocation gap is fine). The time-travel boundary lands in this class for the
// transfer / set-field / set-heap / grant / revoke lanes the prototype proves
// over; the residual is the burn-down for extending the projection to carry an
// interface plane.
//
// Per-window executor metering (`FactoryRegistry::{creation_counts,
// current_epoch}`, rate-limit counters) is NOT reconstructed and NOT part of
// the round-trip law — it is documented non-consensus state (the "Named
// exceptions" in this module's header) that never enters a state commitment.
