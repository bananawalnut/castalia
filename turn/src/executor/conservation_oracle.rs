//! The CROSS-CELL CONSERVATION-ORACLE seam — a runtime-installed decision procedure for the per-asset
//! `Σδ = 0` value-conservation gate, so the deployed executor routes conservation through the verified,
//! Lean-authored `dregg_cross_cell_conserves` (`Dregg2.Circuit.CrossCellConserveDecision.conservesFFI`)
//! instead of the hand-written Rust `dregg_circuit::block_conservation::BlockConservation` twin. This is
//! House Law #1 for the inflation boundary: the deployed conservation decision is COMPUTED BY the Lean
//! source — proved EQUAL to the committed `Dregg2.Circuit.CrossCellConservation` AIR boundary
//! (`creditSum = debitSum` per asset) by `CrossCellConserveRefine.decision_conserves_iff_air_boundary` /
//! `satisfied_imp_decision_conserves` — not a parallel-disconnected Rust copy that can drift (it already
//! drifted once into the asset-blind inflation bug).
//!
//! ## Why a runtime seam (and not a direct FFI call in `atomic.rs`)
//!
//! `dregg-turn` compiles to **wasm32** AND the **zkVM guest**, neither of which can link
//! `libdregg_lean.a`. So `turn` CANNOT call the Lean FFI directly (a hard link would break both builds).
//! This is the same trait-seam architecture the tree uses for the `ConstraintOracle`
//! (`dregg_cell::program::oracle`) and the distributed gates: the crate that DOES link the archive
//! (`dregg-exec-lean`, installed by `dregg-node` at startup) installs the Lean backend; `turn`'s own
//! builds (and wasm / zkVM) keep the labeled Rust fallback in [`super::atomic`].
//!
//! ## Fallback posture (stated plainly)
//!
//! * **Oracle installed** (deployed native node via `dregg-exec-lean`): the verified Lean decision is
//!   authoritative — the executor NEVER decides conservation in Rust.
//! * **No oracle, native RELEASE build** (a deployed node whose archive is stale/absent, or whose
//!   startup install did not fire): **FAIL CLOSED** —
//!   [`super::atomic::AtomicTurnError::ConservationGateUnavailable`]. The Rust `BlockConservation`
//!   fallback is not merely unreachable there, it is **NOT COMPILED**
//!   (`#[cfg(not(all(any(unix, windows), not(debug_assertions))))]`), so no refactor can route back
//!   into it. This is the hole that was open: a missing archive silently returned the deployed node
//!   to the unverified decider on the ASSET-INFLATION boundary with only a build warning.
//! * **No oracle, wasm / zkVM guest** (cannot link Lean by construction): the per-asset boundary is
//!   decided by the LABELED, NON-VERIFIED Rust arithmetic in [`super::atomic`] — a degradation, not
//!   "the check".
//! * **No oracle, native DEBUG build** (`cargo test` across the workspace, which can never link the
//!   archive): the same labeled fallback, so the debug test suite still exercises the arithmetic —
//!   and [`require_verified_conservation_gate`] (`DREGG_REQUIRE_LEAN=1`) promotes it to the same hard
//!   refusal, which is how `turn/tests/conservation_fails_closed_without_gate.rs` drives the
//!   fail-closed pole without a release build.
