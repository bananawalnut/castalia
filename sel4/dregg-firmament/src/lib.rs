//! # dregg-firmament — the cap-gradation bridge (the fluid reach-out, in code)
//!
//! `docs/FIRMAMENT.md §3` makes the firmament's central claim: **an seL4
//! capability and a dregg capability are the same abstraction at different
//! points on a distance parameter.** Both are unforgeable, attenuable,
//! delegable references to a resource; they differ only in *how far away* the
//! resource is and *what bounds hold on operations against it*.
//!
//! This crate turns that design into CODE. The app holds ONE
//! [`Capability`] handle — a `(target, rights)` pair — and invokes /
//! attenuates / delegates it with the SAME verbs regardless of whether the
//! target is:
//!
//! - **local** — an seL4 kernel object (a CNode slot / endpoint). The
//!   invocation is a kernel syscall; attenuation is `seL4_CNode_Mint` with
//!   reduced rights; revocation is `seL4_CNode_Revoke` (synchronous, immediate).
//!   Modeled by [`local::LocalBacking`] (a faithful host stub of the syscall
//!   boundary; on a real PD the same shape calls the Microkit IPC primitives).
//!
//! - **distributed** — a dregg cell on a (possibly remote) federation. The
//!   invocation is a real turn through the executor; attenuation is the real
//!   `recKDelegateAtten` gate (`granted ⊆ held`); revocation is the group-key
//!   epoch lift. Modeled by [`distributed::DistributedBacking`], which runs a
//!   GENUINE [`dregg_turn::TurnExecutor`] turn against a real
//!   [`dregg_cell::Ledger`].
//!
//! **The app does not see which backing it holds.** It holds a [`Capability`];
//! it invokes it; the [`Router`] resolves it to the kernel (local) or the
//! executor→net path (distributed). **Adoption is attenuation** at both ends,
//! and the rights lattice is the SAME [`dregg_cell::AuthRequired`] — the local
//! Mint and the distributed delegate BOTH gate on the real
//! [`dregg_cell::is_attenuation`] (`granted ⊆ held`). We never reinvent the
//! attenuation check.
//!
//! ## The `n = 1` collapse
//!
//! The distance parameter `n` is the number of machines the target is spread
//! across. On the firmament `n = 1` (everything is on one seL4 box), so the
//! distributed bounds collapse to strong local properties (§3 table):
//! revocation is *immediate*, commit is *synchronous*, checkpoint is
//! *consistent*. This crate exposes that as [`Bounds`]: a [`Resolution`]
//! carries the bounds that held for the op, so the SAME handle resolving
//! local-vs-distributed differs ONLY in the relaxed bounds, never in the verbs.
//!
//! That is the fluid reach-out: first-class locally (the strong `n = 1`
//! properties), seamless to the wire (the bounds simply relax as `n` rises).
//!
//! ## The semihost ([`EmulatedKernel`] + the [`microkit_facade`])
//!
//! `docs/DREGG-DESKTOP-OS.md §3` (the semihosted-seL4 KEYSTONE) makes the local
//! leg *runnable on your mac/linux today*: the [`EmulatedKernel`] PROMOTES
//! [`LocalBacking`]'s CNode slot-table with the three seL4 IPC primitives (a
//! synchronous Endpoint, a badge-OR Notification, Untyped+Retype), and the
//! [`microkit_facade`] ships the `sel4-microkit`-shaped API (a
//! `#[protection_domain]`-style entry, [`Handler`], [`Channel`], [`MessageInfo`],
//! [`memory_region_symbol!`]) the dregg PDs code against — std-backed (semihost)
//! now, real seL4 later, **the same PD source on both**. It is a faithful
//! `n = 1` firmament (a host thread's revoke IS synchronous; the cap checks are
//! the genuine [`is_attenuation`]).
//!
//! ### Two backings, cfg-selected (the v0 isolation gap is CLOSED)
//!
//! The semihost has TWO cfg-selected backings under ONE facade:
//!
//! - **v0 — thread-backed** ([`EmulatedKernel`], the default): PDs are host
//!   threads in one address space. Fast (no `fork`), ideal for `cargo test`. It
//!   carries ONE honestly-labeled non-fidelity: "no ambient authority" is
//!   by-construction-in-the-API, NOT MMU-enforced (a malicious thread could read
//!   another PD's memory; raw RAM has no tag bits to stop cap forgery). See
//!   [`EmulatedKernel::ISOLATION_FIDELITY`].
//! - **v1 — process-backed** ([`process_kernel::ProcessKernel`], `--features
//!   process-pd`, Unix): PDs are forked PROCESSES, so the host **MMU enforces**
//!   address-space separation — a PD physically cannot read another PD's private
//!   memory. Shared regions are `shm_open`/`mmap` segments granted by name; and
//!   an epoch-tagged cap-handle **validity table** (the kernel's, the
//!   cross-process CNode-unforgeability analogue) refuses a cap forged from raw
//!   bytes. This **closes** the v0 gap; what remains trusted is stated honestly
//!   (the table is the kernel's TCB; the MMU is the host OS's). See
//!   [`process_kernel::ProcessKernel::ISOLATION_FIDELITY`].
//!
//! **The PD source is UNCHANGED across both** — only the backing moves
//! thread→process. The boot test (m0-hello + the 2-PD notify slice) runs on
//! both, and the v1 path adds the isolation tooth v0 lacked (a PD CANNOT read
//! another PD's memory NOR forge a cap by writing raw bytes, while IPC still
//! works). `docs/DREGG-DESKTOP-OS.md §3`.

// builds the corresponding scene-gated `present()`, and advances the framebuffer
// it SOLELY holds — the focused cell re-paints the instant the turn lands. A
// REJECTED turn projects NOTHING + notifies NOTHING (fail-closed). This is the
// SAME idea as the deos `deos-js/src/signals.rs` dirty-set → repaint-hook model,
// lifted across the seL4 PD boundary (the dirty-set is a `DirtyRegion` in a
// shared region; the repaint hook is the compositor's `present()` fired by an IPC
// notify). It adds ONLY the projection (turn-commit ⟼ DirtyRegion) + the wire
