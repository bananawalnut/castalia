//! The `ProcessKernel` — the v1 PROCESS-backed firmament substrate (the
//! MMU-enforced isolation upgrade `docs/DREGG-DESKTOP-OS.md §3` names).
//!
//! ## Why this module exists (the ONE fidelity gap, now closed)
//!
//! The v0 [`crate::EmulatedKernel`] is a faithful `n = 1` firmament with exactly
//! ONE honestly-labeled non-fidelity: its protection domains (PDs) are host
//! THREADS sharing one address space, so "no ambient authority" is
//! by-construction-in-the-API, **NOT MMU-enforced**. A malicious thread could
//! read another PD's memory by a raw pointer; and because host RAM has no CHERI
//! tag bits, a thread could fabricate a kernel-object handle by writing raw
//! bytes. v0 said so plainly ([`crate::EmulatedKernel::ISOLATION_FIDELITY`]) and
//! did NOT launder it.
//!
//! This module closes that gap, exactly the way UML's traced-thread → SKAS
//! evolution closed its analogue: **PDs become host PROCESSES (`fork`), so the
//! OS MMU enforces address-space separation — a PD physically cannot read
//! another PD's memory.** Three load-bearing pieces:
//!
//! 1. **PROCESS-backed PDs** ([`ProcessKernel::spawn_pd`]) — each PD is a forked
//!    child with its own page tables. The kernel-equivalent of seL4's
//!    address-space separation is now the host kernel's, not a Rust convention.
//!    A read of another PD's heap address faults (SIGSEGV) or lands in this PD's
//!    own unrelated memory — it can NEVER observe the other PD's secret.
//!
//! 2. **`shm_open`/`mmap` shared regions** ([`ProcessKernel::create_region`])
//!    replacing v0's `&mut [u8]` thread-shared buffers. A region is a named
//!    POSIX shared-memory object the kernel creates; a PD maps it ONLY if the
//!    kernel hands it the (name, len) at grant time. A PD that was not granted a
//!    region does not know its randomized name and cannot map it — the
//!    `memory_region_symbol!` mapping is a real per-PD MMU mapping, not a shared
//!    pointer. Two PDs that ARE both granted the same region see each other's
//!    writes (the genuine shared-ring-buffer the net-client's smoltcp code
//!    needs), but neither can reach the other's PRIVATE memory.
//!
//! 3. **THE CAP-INTEGRITY PIECE — an epoch-tagged cap-handle validity table**
//!    ([`ValidityTable`]). Host RAM has no tag bits, so a PD must NOT be able to
//!    forge a cap by writing raw bytes into a shared region. The kernel holds a
//!    validity table mapping each opaque [`CapHandle`] → its `(epoch, object)`.
//!    A PD presents a handle to invoke an object; the kernel checks it against
//!    the table FIRST, so a forged / raw-bytes / stale-epoch handle FAILS with
//!    [`CapError::Forged`]. This is the cross-process analogue of CNode
//!    unforgeability: in seL4 a cap is unforgeable because it lives in the
//!    kernel's CNode, never in the PD's address space; here a cap-handle is
//!    unforgeable because its VALIDITY lives in the kernel's table, never in the
//!    PD's RAM. **This is the part that makes raw-bytes cap-forgery impossible.**
//!
//! ## Fidelity discipline (don't-launder-vacuity, §3) — what is now enforced
//!
//! | property                         | v0 (thread)            | v1 (process)                    |
//! |----------------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------|
//! | cross-PD private-memory read     | by-construction-in-API | **MMU-enforced** (separate VA)  |
//! | cap-handle forgery (raw bytes)   | possible in principle  | **refused** by the validity table |
//! | shared region access             | shared `&mut [u8]`     | per-PD `mmap` of a named shm    |
//! | the cap *attenuation* lattice    | real `is_attenuation`  | real `is_attenuation` (unchanged) |
//!
//! What remains by-construction / trusted, stated HONESTLY (NOT laundered):
//!
//! - **The validity table is the KERNEL's, and the kernel is trusted.** That is
//!   correct and intended — it is the TCB, the host-userspace stand-in for the
//!   seL4 kernel's CNode. The PD cannot forge a cap precisely because validity
//!   is the kernel's to decide, never the PD's. We do not claim the kernel
//!   itself is confined from itself.
//! - **The MMU is the HOST OS's.** The address-space separation is enforced by
//!   the real macOS/Linux page tables, not by anything in this crate — that is
//!   the whole point (it is REAL isolation, not modeled isolation), and it is
//!   the same enforcement a real seL4 PD relies on the seL4 kernel + hardware
//!   MMU for. We trust the host kernel exactly as the deployment trusts seL4.
//! - **The shm name is a capability-by-obscurity at the POSIX layer** — a PD not
//!   handed the name cannot map the region. We harden this with an unguessable
//!   random name AND `O_EXCL` creation + immediate `shm_unlink` (so the name is
//!   removed from the namespace after both ends map it, leaving only the already-
//!   open mappings — a PD that never received the fd/name can no longer open it
//!   at all). The genuinely-strong story (an fd passed by `SCM_RIGHTS`, no name
//!   in any shared namespace) is noted where it would tighten further.
//!
//! ## Same-code claim across BOTH backings
//!
//! The [`crate::microkit_facade`] API a PD codes against (`Handler`, `Channel`,
//! `Region`, `memory_region_symbol!`, the `init()` body) is UNCHANGED. The
//! boot test ([`tests/boot_pds.rs`]'s m0-hello + the 2-PD notify slice) runs on
//! the process backing too: the same PD source, only the BACKING moves
//! thread→process. That is verified by the process-backed boot test
//! ([`tests/process_isolation.rs`]).
//!
//! ## Portability
//!
//! This module is **Unix-only** (`fork`/`shm_open`/`mmap`/`socketpair` —
//! macOS + Linux, the semihost's host platforms) and gated behind the
//! `process-pd` Cargo feature, so the default fast `cargo test` keeps the v0
//! thread backing and the real-isolation path is opt-in. The v0 thread backing
//! ([`crate::EmulatedKernel`]) is NOT removed — this EXTENDS it with a
//! cfg-selected backing, it does not fork a parallel mock.
