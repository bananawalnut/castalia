# The Lean seed as a release artifact — verified nodes in minutes, not hours

The single biggest barrier to a stranger running a **verified** `dregg-node` is the Lean seed:
`dregg-lean-ffi/libdregg_lean.a`, a ~180 MB native static archive of the compiled verified
executor plus its entire mathlib/batteries/aesop/Qq dependency closure (~6000 objects). It is
**gitignored** (an architecture-native Mach-O/ELF blob — never a repo blob), so a fresh clone that
runs `cargo build` without it silently builds **marshal-only**: `lean_available()==false`, and the
node runs the *un-verified* Rust executor. Regenerating the seed from source is an **hours-long**
cold `lake` bootstrap (it compiles mathlib).

This document describes the mechanism that turns that into a **minutes-long** download: publish a
HEAD-matching seed as a **GitHub release asset**, and fetch it on a fresh clone.

See also `docs/BUILD-LEAN-LINKED-NODE.md` (the build-time story + the `DREGG_REQUIRE_LEAN` gate).

## The pieces

| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `scripts/lean-seed-key.sh` | Computes the seed **provenance + content key** (platform · Lean toolchain · mathlib rev · **Dregg2.FFI boundary-closure** hash) and the canonical asset name. Shared by fetch + publish. |
| `dregg-lean-ffi/lean-seed.pin` | The committed **pointer**: the stable release `TAG` plus a reference provenance snapshot used by the drift gate. Assets, not tags, are content-keyed. |
| `scripts/fetch-lean-seed.sh` | Downloads the platform-native seed asset from the pinned release, **verifies the sha256 + the `dregg_*` exports**, and installs it at `dregg-lean-ffi/libdregg_lean.a`. |
| `.github/workflows/lean-seed.yml` | The self-hosted **publish** workflow: build the seed, verify the live kernel, and upload the content-keyed asset + `.sha256` to the stable release. It never rewrites a human branch. |
| `.github/workflows/castalia-bootstrap-node.yml` | The protected hosted-runner fallback: rebuild the complete Lean graph from pinned source, re-emit descriptors, attest the seed, then build and boot a `DREGG_REQUIRE_LEAN=1` Linux node. |
| `scripts/run-node-10min.sh` | The end-to-end "clone → seed → build → run → verify" convenience path. |

## The seed key (why an asset is HEAD-matching)

A seed archive is valid only for a specific **platform** (Mach-O arm64 ≠ ELF x86_64), **Lean
toolchain** (the runtime/stdlib ABI it links against), **mathlib pin** (its dependency closure),
and the **`Dregg2.FFI` boundary closure** (the executor slice baked in — used verbatim on the fetch
path, where a fresh clone has no warm `.lake` to re-splice from). `scripts/lean-seed-key.sh` hashes
exactly those into a short key and names the asset:

```
libdregg_lean-<os>-<arch>-<lean-tag>-<key>.a.zst
# e.g. libdregg_lean-Linux-x86_64-v4.30.0-1a2b3c4d5e6f7a8b.a.zst
```

Same key ⇒ interchangeable seed. `fetch-lean-seed.sh` computes the local key, downloads the asset
of that exact name, and **warns loudly** if the committed pin's `DREGG_CLOSURE_HASH` has drifted
from your checkout (a stale seed whose Dregg2 slice predates your source — the closure link may
then need a warm local `.lake`).

> ⚑ **The fourth input changed on 2026-08-07, and it is a flag day.** It used to be
> `git rev-parse HEAD:metatheory/Dregg2` — all **2246** modules. The archive contains ONE target's

> splices, and the set `scripts/check-lean-seed-closure.sh` already checks an archive against).
> Measured over the last 300 commits touching `metatheory/Dregg2/`: only **69 (23.0%)** touched

> uncommitted Lean edits move the key, which is what lets `build.rs` treat a match as evidence.
> **All 152 assets published under the old scheme are unreachable by the new name.** Re-cut with
> `gh workflow run lean-seed.yml -f platforms=linux-x86_64`.

> ⓘ **A key-matched seed is now accepted as current-source evidence.** `fetch-lean-seed.sh` writes

## Fetching (the fast path, for everyone)

```sh
# 1. elan + the pinned toolchain must be on PATH (installs in minutes; NO mathlib compile):
curl https://elan.lean-lang.org/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh    # then re-open your shell

# 2. fetch the prebuilt seed for your platform:
./scripts/fetch-lean-seed.sh

# 3. build a VERIFIED node, failing loud on any silent marshal-only degrade:
DREGG_REQUIRE_LEAN=1 cargo build -p dregg-node --release
```

The seed links against the toolchain's Lean runtime; if `lake env` can't be found at build time,
export the sysroot explicitly: `export DREGG_LEAN_SYSROOT="$(cd metatheory && lake env printenv LEAN_SYSROOT)"`.

If no seed release has been cut yet, `fetch-lean-seed.sh` **fails loud** and points you at either a
local `./scripts/bootstrap.sh` (the slow, hours-long path) or cutting a release (below). The
`DREGG_REQUIRE_LEAN=1` gate guarantees you can never *silently* ship a marshal-only node — the
build panics with the exact cause instead. (Confirmed wired: `dregg-lean-ffi/build.rs`
`degrade_guard`, and a `--release` native build defaults the gate ON.)

## Cutting a seed release — CI builds and verifies the bytes

Seeding compiles thousands of leanc objects. `metatheory/lakefile.toml` pins mathlib as a
**portable `git`+`rev` dependency**, so `lake` fetches it on any host with no clone-location
assumption. The preferred recurring path uses the labeled self-hosted runner. The protected
Castalia bootstrap workflow is the cold hosted-runner fallback: it checkpoints the graph across
jobs, builds the archive from pinned source, attests it, and uses those exact bytes to build and
boot the release node. An operator may promote that workflow artifact to the stable seed release
only after the protected job succeeds and the archive key and checksums are re-verified locally.

### Automatic (the model)

`.github/workflows/lean-seed.yml` runs on **every push to `metatheory/**`** (plus a nightly
safety net, plus manual dispatch). It computes the content **key** for the checkout
(`scripts/lean-seed-key.sh`), and — unless an asset for that exact key already exists on the
`lean-seed` release — it re-splices the Dregg2 slice at HEAD
(`dregg-lean-ffi/scripts/rebuild-dregg2-closure.sh`), verifies the archive links and the kernel
round-trips, compresses, and uploads `<asset>.a.zst` + `.sha256` to the release with
`GITHUB_TOKEN`. The committed pin already carries `TAG=lean-seed`; the workflow deliberately does
not commit or rebase the caller's branch. Assets are **content-keyed**, so one stable tag
accumulates every platform × every revision and `fetch-lean-seed.sh` always resolves the asset for
*its* checkout. A maintainer updates only the reference provenance snapshot when the drift gate
needs to record a newly published closure.

**One-time human prerequisite:** a self-hosted runner must be **registered** on `emberian/dregg`
(Settings → Actions → Runners) with the labels `self-hosted`, `lean-seed`, and its platform
(`linux-x86_64` for a Linux host such as *lassie*/hbox; `darwin-arm64` for a Mac such as nextop).
The host needs `elan` (lake), `cargo`, `zstd`, and `ar`/`ranlib`/`nm` on PATH. That is the whole
bootstrap: once a runner answers those labels, every future `metatheory/**` push seeds itself, and
the downstream faithfulness gate (`ci.yml`) + verified-gate hard mode (`armed-teeth.yml`) arm
themselves off the pin with no further edits. Until a runner is registered, the `seed` job simply
queues (nothing hand-uploads in the meantime), and the consumer gates report their unarmed state
loudly rather than faking a green.

Serve Linux-x86_64 first — it is the platform `ci.yml`'s hosted runners consume; Darwin-arm64 is a
developer-fetch convenience, dispatch-selectable via the workflow's `platforms` input.

### By hand on a build host — the cold-bootstrap recipe (fallback only)

Prefer the workflow above. This manual recipe is a **break-glass fallback** for when no runner is
registered yet and someone needs a seed immediately; the workflow does all of it automatically.

This is the full ordered command list to cut the **first** seed on a fresh Linux box. Nothing here
depends on a host-specific path — mathlib is git-fetched by lake.

```sh
# 0. Prerequisites (once per box). elan installs in minutes; it does NOT compile mathlib.
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh          # rust (cargo)
curl https://elan.lean-lang.org/elan-init.sh -sSf | sh                  # elan (lake); re-open shell
#   plus: git, zstd, and GitHub `gh` (authed: `gh auth login`) on PATH.

# 1. Clone breadstuffs anywhere (clone LOCATION does not matter — the mathlib pin is git+rev).
git clone git@github.com:emberian/dregg.git breadstuffs
cd breadstuffs

# 2. Cold-bootstrap the verified Lean seed. bootstrap.sh:
#      - reads the mathlib git pin from metatheory/lakefile.toml,
#      - runs `lake exe cache get` to pull mathlib's PREBUILT oleans (minutes, not the hours-long
#        from-source compile),
#      - `lake build`s the Dregg2.Exec.FFI closure,
#      - seeds dregg-lean-ffi/libdregg_lean.a and verifies the FFI kernel round-trips.
#    EXPECTED TIME (honest): with the mathlib cache available this is ~30-90 min on lassie (the
#    leanc compile of the ~6000-object Dregg2+deps closure dominates). If the mathlib prebuilt
#    cache is UNAVAILABLE for this rev, mathlib compiles from source and it is HOURS — this is the
#    one-time cold-boot cost the published seed exists to spare everyone else.
./scripts/bootstrap.sh

# 3. Name + compress + checksum the platform-native seed (asset name encodes os·arch·lean·key).
asset="$(scripts/lean-seed-key.sh --asset)"                             # libdregg_lean-Linux-x86_64-v4.30.0-<key>.a.zst
zstd -q -19 --long=27 -T0 dregg-lean-ffi/libdregg_lean.a -o "$asset"    # ~180 MB → ~20 MB
sha256sum "$asset" > "$asset.sha256"

# 4. Publish to the stable release (create it if absent), then upload the content-keyed asset.
tag=lean-seed
gh release create "$tag" --title "Lean seed archives" --notes "Content-keyed verified Lean seed archives." || true
gh release upload  "$tag" "$asset" "$asset.sha256" --clobber

# 5. Record the live DREGG_CLOSURE_HASH + GENERATED_UTC in lean-seed.pin for the drift gate.
#    TAG remains lean-seed; fetch computes the content-keyed asset name from the checkout.
git add dregg-lean-ffi/lean-seed.pin
git -c commit.gpgsign=false commit -m "chore(seed): record published Lean closure"
git push
```

The **hand-back to the maintainer**: the release tag, the asset filename, and its sha256. From then
on `scripts/fetch-lean-seed.sh` links a verified node in minutes for anyone on that platform.

The compressed asset is small (~20 MB for the ~180 MB archive, ≈8.6× with `zstd -19`).

## The security posture

- The seed is **content-addressed** by a published `.sha256` sidecar; `fetch-lean-seed.sh` refuses
  to install on a checksum mismatch (corruption/tamper) and refuses an archive lacking the
  `dregg_exec_full_forest_auth` export (wrong/placeholder file).
- A seed is a *build accelerator*, not a *trust root*: the verified guarantee comes from the Lean
  proofs compiled into it, and the same source rebuilds it bit-for-bit deterministically. A paranoid
  operator can always ignore the artifact and `./scripts/bootstrap.sh` from source.
- The seed is **never** committed to the repo (`.gitignore`: `libdregg_lean.a*`) — only published as
  a release asset.

## The mathlib pin is portable (git+rev)

`metatheory/lakefile.toml` pins mathlib as a **`git`+`rev` dependency** at the exact revision
matching Lean `v4.30.0` (`1c2b90b13009c65b090d95a83c98e248deafb6f1`). `lake` fetches it into
`metatheory/.lake/packages/mathlib` on any host — a fresh clone at **any location** resolves, with
no `/Users/…` / `/home/…` / clone-depth assumption. (This replaced a host-fragile
`path = "../../../src/mathlib4"` local require that only resolved when breadstuffs was cloned exactly
two levels under `$HOME` with mathlib as a `$HOME/src` sibling — which broke a fresh Linux
cold-bootstrap on lassie.)

**Local fast path (maintainer boxes, optional — no re-download):** if you already have a warm
mathlib checkout at the pinned rev, symlink it into the packages dir *before* the first `lake build`
so lake reuses it (its warm `.lake/build` oleans and all) instead of cloning + re-fetching:

```sh
ln -sfn /path/to/your/mathlib4 metatheory/.lake/packages/mathlib
```

`.lake/` is gitignored and per-machine, so this changes nothing committed. Plain `lake build` reads
the manifest and uses whatever is in the packages dir as-is (it does not `git fetch`/`checkout` your
symlinked checkout — only `lake update` would), so the symlinked mathlib is left untouched.
