# DESIGN — the canonical byte→felt codec

**Status:** design, pre-implementation. No code changed by this document.
**Date:** 2026-07-24.
**Supersedes as the *plan of record*** (not the evidence) for: `docs/WOUND-felt-width-boundaries-2026-07-19.md`
entries #5, #6, #9, #11, #18, #19, #20, #23, #24, #33, and `docs/FAITHFUL-COMMITMENT-LAW.md`'s
constructor discipline.
**Evidence:** six independent source-read census lanes, 2026-07-24. Every quantitative claim below
that is *not* attributed to a lane was re-derived here against the tree at `HEAD`; the arithmetic
facts in §2 are the ones the recommendation rests on and each was read from source, not inferred.

---

## 1. The root cause

**No canonical codec was ever designated.** Every author who needed to put 32 bytes into a BabyBear
trace invented the mapping at the point of need, from the same folk knowledge ("chop into 4-byte
chunks, reduce mod p"), and each invention lost information in a *different* way. Nobody was
reckless; each site is locally reasonable. The failure is architectural: **a byte→felt map is a
protocol primitive and it was treated as a local utility.**

Two consequences, and they explain the whole shape of the wound catalogue:

1. **33 wound entries look like 33 problems.** They are not. They are **4 arithmetic families**
   surfacing at ~52 places. Fix the 4 families and the 33 entries close together.
2. **Every doc-comment written at a call site describes a property the author *wanted*, not the
   property the arithmetic *has*** — because the author was reasoning about their own site, not
   about a designated primitive with a stated contract. Hence 30+ false injectivity /
   "~256-bit binding" comments (§6), several of which contradict a *correct* comment in the
   same file.

### 1.1 The four families

| # | Family | Arithmetic | Failure mode | Cost to break |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **F1** | **MOD-P ALIAS** | 8 × (4-byte LE u32) `% p` | `v` and `v+p` collide for 53.1% of chunks | **O(1)** (add `p`), no grind |
| **F2** | **BIT-DISCARD** | 8 × (8+8+8+6 bits), drops bits 6–7 of every 4th byte | 16 of 256 source bits unbound | **O(1)** collision, but only ~2^120 for a *meaningful* second value |
| **F3** | **NON-CANONICAL SEED** | Poseidon2 sponge *over an F1 encoding*, squeezed to **1 felt** | inherits F1's O(1) collision **upstream of the hash**; plus ~2^15.45 birthday on the 1-felt image | **O(1)** where bytes are attacker-chosen; ~2^15.45 / ~2^31 where they are a hash image |
| **F4** | **LINEAR FOLD** | `Σ limbᵢ · MIX^i (mod p)` over an F1 encoding | an **onto F_p-linear form**: collisions *and* hits on a chosen target felt are one linear solve | **O(1) for both**, including *targeted* |

F3 and F4 both sit on top of F1, so **F1 is the seed of three of the four families.** F2 is
independent (the KEY_COMMIT lineage).

The critical structural point: **F3's Poseidon2 does not rescue it.** The reduction happens
*before* the sponge, so the sponge is fed identical inputs and cannot undo the collision. The
sponge does restore *preimage* hardness (aliasing yields no preimage), which is why F3 sites split
cleanly by whether the attacker chooses the bytes or receives them as a hash image. This split is
the single most useful triage axis in the whole catalogue.

### 1.2 Census totals

Raw symbol references, `grep` over `*.rs` excluding `target/`, at HEAD:

| Symbol | refs / files | | Symbol | refs / files |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `fold_bytes32` (F3, incl. `_to_bb`) | 166 / 42 | | `canonical_32_to_felts_4` (F2) | 75 / 17 |
| `bytes32_to_8_limbs` (F1) | 135 / 31 | | `encode_hash` (F1 root) | 74 / 29 |
| `bytes_to_babybear` (F3) | 117 / 22 | | `hash_to_8` (F1, 8 refs are a name collision) | 63 / 10 |
| `fold_bytes32_to_bb` (F4) | 109 / 28 | | `field_limbs8` (⚑ **no longer F1**, see below) | 62 / 17 |
| `hash_bytes` (F3, heavily name-polluted) | 218 / — | | `commitment_to_field` (F3) | 41 / 10 |
| `bytes32_to_felt8` (F1) | 28 / 10 | | `canonical_to_babybear_pi` (F2) | 21 / 5 |
| `canonical_32_to_felts_8` (F2) | 19 / 8 | | `from_bytes_packed` (F1, var-len) | 15 / 7 |
| `bytes32_to_limbs` (F1 clone) | 13 / 2 | | `encode_bytes_to_felts` (injective, 3-byte) | 10 / 3 |
| **`bytes32_to_u16_limbs` (F5 — correct)** | **7 / 1** | | **`bytes32_to_u16_le` (F5 — correct)** | **4 / 1** |
| **`bytes32_to_u16_be` (F5 — correct, BE)** | **2 / 1** | | | |

**After de-duplication across the six lanes** (≈8 site-groups were reported by two lanes each —
cap `target`/`breadstuff`, heap value, umem key/value, zkoracle leaves, `commitment_to_field`,
`revocation_hash_to_field`, `Faithful8::from_bytes32`):

| Bucket | Count | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| **SECURITY site-groups** | **~52** | reaches a commitment, PI binding, authorizing equality, or a map/sort key |
| — of those, **O(1)-exploitable today** | **~20** | attacker chooses the bytes; a colliding pair is *constructed*, not searched |
| — of those, **~2^15.45–2^31** | **~24** | input is a hash image; needs a grind or a birthday search |
| — of those, **~2^120** | **~8** | F2 bit-discard; a colliding *string* is free, a colliding *meaningful value* is not |
| **STRUCTURAL** (width/geometry) | **~18** | a fix moves AIR columns, PI layout, or a committed root |
| **BENIGN** | **207** | tests, fixtures, benches, examples, doc lines, domain constants |
| **DEAD** | **11** | `#[allow(dead_code)]` / zero callers, grep-confirmed |
| **Distinct encoder implementations** | **~17 names** | across ~14 crates, realizing **4** distinct arithmetics |

**Honest sizing, since the ask invited it:** this is not 490 problems and it is not 12. It is
**~52 security site-groups generated by 4 arithmetics under ~17 names**, of which **~20 are
O(1)-exploitable**. The 207 benign references are real noise — most of the raw grep volume is
tests. And an important sobering note that every lane independently reached: **the census found no
demonstrated *soundness* break.** Nearly every site projects identically on the producer and
verifier sides, so a collision *over-includes* (an honest turn goes UNSAT, a distinct fresh
nullifier is refused) rather than authorizing a forgery. The realized class is
**availability/denial with occasionally global blast radius**, not theft. Two candidates for a
genuine soundness break are flagged as **unknowns** in §7 — they are the ones worth a falsifier
before anything else.

The ratio that names the disease: **~17 implementations, 4 intents.** An order of magnitude more
copies than distinct meanings.

## 2. The canonical codec

The brief asked whether `bytes32_to_u16_limbs` is right, and specifically whether an **injective
8-felt** encoding exists, since 16 felts is 2× the width and width costs columns. That is the
load-bearing question, so it gets a real answer rather than a preference.

### 2.1 There is no injective 8-felt encoding. This is a pigeonhole theorem, not an engineering gap.

`BABYBEAR_P = 2^31 − 2^27 + 1 = 2013265921` (`circuit/src/field.rs:12`, read).

```
log2(p) = 31 + log2(0.937500000465…) = 30.906891 bits
8 felts  →  p^8  ≈ 2^247.2551
domain   →  2^256
deficit  →  2^8.745  ≈  429×
```

A map `[u8;32] → F_p^8` has a codomain **8.75 bits too small**. At least `2^256 − p^8 ≈ 0.9977 ·
2^256` inputs — **99.77% of all 32-byte strings** — must participate in a collision. No choice of
limb geometry, range check, or gate changes this.

The two candidates named in the brief both die here:

* **"8 limbs of 31 bits with a canonicity range-check."** A 31-bit range is `[0, 2^31)`, and
  `p < 2^31`, so a 31-bit limb is not a canonical felt. Range-check to `< p` instead and you have
  `p^8 < 2^256`. Dead.
* **"8 × 32-bit limbs with an explicit alias-rejecting gate."** Rejecting aliases means constraining
  each limb to `[0, p)`. A uniformly random 4-byte chunk is canonical with probability
  `p / 2^32 = 0.46875`, so the gate **accepts `0.46875^8 = 0.233%` of 32-byte strings** — it would
  reject 99.77% of BLAKE3 digests. Dead as a general codec.

  *But this gate is exactly right in the other direction*, and we already have it — see §2.4.

**Minimum injective width is `ceil(256 / 30.906891) = 9 felts.**

### 2.2 The width worry is the wrong worry: `CHIP_RATE = 16`

The decisive measurement, read from source and confirmed on both sides:

```
circuit/src/descriptor_ir2.rs:308   pub const CHIP_RATE: usize = 16;
circuit/src/descriptor_ir2.rs:2242  pub const CHIP_OUT_LANES: usize = 8;
metatheory/Dregg2/Circuit/DescriptorIR2.lean:160  def CHIP_RATE : Nat := 16
metatheory/Dregg2/Circuit/DescriptorIR2.lean:175  def CHIP_OUT_LANES : Nat := 8
```

**The deployed Poseidon2 chip absorbs 16 lanes per permutation and squeezes 8.**

Therefore:

* Today's 8-limb encodings (F1, F2) consume **half the chip's absorb rate**. One 32-byte value
  occupies 8 of 16 available lanes.
* A 16 × u16 encoding consumes **exactly one full chip absorb** for one 32-byte value.
* **⇒ At every site where the encoder output is absorbed into a sponge — which is the large
  majority of the ~52 — migrating 8→16 limbs costs ZERO additional permutations.** The "2× width"
  penalty is paid out of rate the chip already has and currently wastes.

The width penalty is real only where limbs sit in **persistent columns** (PI slots, carrier octets,
trace param columns) rather than being absorbed. And for those sites the answer is not to store
limbs at all — see §2.3.

Pricing the alternatives on this basis:

| Codec | Felts | Absorbs | Range check | Byte-aligned | In tree | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 9 × base-`p` digits | 9 | 1 | big-int `< 2^256` borrow chain | **no** | no | minimum width, worst gadget — but `field_limbs9` below reaches 9 felts *without* this shape |
| **9 × `field_limbs9`** | **9** | **1** | **none for injectivity; canonicity is 7 × `< 2^28`** | **yes** | **Lean `Circuit/FieldLanes9.lean`, Rust `effect_vm::field_limbs9`** | **recommended at committed, persistent, ABI-pinned slots** |
| 11 × u24 | 11 | 1 | 2^24 table (too large) or 16+8 split ⇒ **22** lookups | yes | no | **strictly dominated** — no absorb saving over u16, *more* range constraints, a 5th codec to prove |
| **16 × u16** | **16** | **1** | **16 lookups at the standard 2^16 width** | **yes** | **4× in Rust, 1× in Lean** | **recommended for absorbed preimages** |
| 8 × u32 mod p (today) | 8 | 1 | none | yes | everywhere | non-injective, O(1) collisions |

**`field_limbs9` is not "9 × base-`p` digits", and that is why it prices differently.** It is 2
pinned `u32 % p` lanes — the kernel u64 window, unchanged deployed ABI — plus **7 base-`2^28` digits**
of `W = ofDigits 256 (b[0..24] ++ [q₀ + 4·q₁])`, where the single extra base-256 digit carries the two
quotients the pinned lanes' `mod p` discards. So it needs no borrow chain, it *is* byte-aligned (a
25-byte source repacked into 28-bit digits), it is injective (`fieldToLanes9_injective`), and the Lean
model is 486 lines — a total decoder plus a machine-checked left inverse, `#assert_axioms`-clean.

**So there are two recommendations, split by slot kind.** `Limbs16` is the map for **absorbed
preimages** (§2.6), where 16 lanes is exactly one `CHIP_RATE` absorb. At a **committed, persistent,
ABI-pinned slot** the minimum-width injective encoding wins instead — and at the **`fields[0..8]`
rotated slots specifically, `Limbs16` is disqualified twice over**:

1. **It cannot hold lane 0.** A 16-bit lane cannot carry the kernel's 32-bit u64-lane `lo32`, which
   `field_to_u64`, `gFieldWriteP1`, the escrow / discharge / vault welds and every app encoder read.
   §2.2's "width is free" argument is about ABSORB RATE; these are **persistent columns**, which is
   the one case §2.2 itself excludes ("the width penalty is real only where limbs sit in persistent
   columns").
2. **It does not fit the layout.** 8 fields × 16 lanes = 128 columns against the nonet's 72, so
   `NUM_PRE_LIMBS` 184 → 240, which **violates `RotatedLayout.Legal.bodyAligned`** (`236 % 3 = 2`;
   the wire-commit chain folds arity-3 after an arity-4 head) and would have to be 241 with a column
   wasted. That is `B_SPAN` 247 → 323 and `APPENDIX_SPAN` 537 → 689: **+152 columns on each of the
   174 emitted members and +38 Poseidon2 absorptions per row** — buying nothing, since both
   encodings are injective and the anchor's binding is the sponge's (`2^123.63`) either way.

11 × u24 is the interesting near-miss and it loses cleanly: it saves 5 felts of *preimage* width,
which buys nothing because both fit in one absorb, and pays for it with a range-check story that
either needs a 16-million-row table or decomposes back into 16-bit lookups anyway.

### 2.3 The design: two layers, because injectivity and binding are different requirements

The zoo exists partly because one map was asked to do two jobs. Separate them:

**Layer L — `Limbs16`: the injective byte→felt map.**

```
Limbs16(b: [u8;32]) = [ BabyBear(u16::from_le_bytes([b[2i], b[2i+1]])) ; i in 0..16 ]
```

Injective by construction (`2^16 ≪ p`, so no reduction occurs and the inverse is a memcpy).
In-AIR canonicity is 16 range checks at 16 bits — the cheapest lookup width available.
Used wherever the value must be **recoverable, ordered, or range-checked**: sorted-map addresses,
AAFI brackets, lex comparators, hash preimages, witness columns.

**Layer D — `Digest8`: the binding fixed-width commitment.**

```
Digest8(domain, b) = chip_squeeze( domain ‖ Limbs16(b) )      // one permutation, 8 output lanes
```

Not injective — §2.1 proves nothing 8-wide can be — but **hard**: collision cost is the birthday
bound over `p^8`, i.e. **2^123.63**, versus the F1 encodings' **O(1)**. That is the entire point.
Used wherever a value must be **bound in a fixed-width committed slot**: PI octets, carrier
octets, state-commitment limbs, map values.

**The reframe this forces, and it is the substantive one:** the failing sites do not fail because
they are non-injective. `Digest8` is non-injective too and is fine. They fail because they are
**raw non-injective *projections* (free, constructible collisions) where a *hard* non-injective
*compression* was required.** "Injective" was never the security property; it is a *sufficient*
property that Layer L happens to have for free, and it is the *necessary* property only where the
felts must be inverted or ordered.

**Width consequence:** at PI/column sites, `Digest8` is **8 felts — the same width as today**, and
in several places *narrower* (`bridge_action_witness.rs`, now retired, published 24 PI slots as
3 × 8 limbs; 3 × `Digest8` is also 24, but `effect_action_air`'s per-field 8-slot layouts and
`ci_assurance`'s `CI_PI_COUNT = 25` are unchanged). **The migration is width-neutral at the
committed boundary and rate-neutral at the hashed boundary.** The 2× cost ember was rightly
worried about does not materialize anywhere it would have mattered.

**Banned by construction:** `Digest1` — any 32-byte value compressed to a *single* felt. Birthday
cost is `2^15.45`. There is no security boundary where that is acceptable. Sites that structurally
need one felt (today's 1-felt map keys and the `iroot` MMR) migrate to `Limbs16` keys with a lex
comparator, or to `Digest8` — not to a better 1-felt fold.

### 2.4 We already own the hard part, in Lean, `#guard`-checked

`metatheory/Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/FaithfulNoteSpendDescriptorPlan.lean` already contains the full
canonical-codec machinery, authored on the correct substrate:

* `BYTES32_U16_LIMBS := 16`, `U64_U16_LIMBS := 4` (`:58`, `:59`) — Layer L, with the file's stated
  convention: *"Every multi-limb integer/byte string is little-endian."*
* `u16Ranges base count` (`:384`) building a `RangePlan` of 16-bit checks; `rangePlan.length == 132`
  is `#guard`-ed (`:399`) — the range-check discipline, already emitted.
* **`Pack8Plan` / `packBodiesAt` (`:339`–`:373`) — the canonical `Digest8 ↔ Limbs16` bridge**, and
  it is precisely the "alias-rejecting gate" from §2.1 applied in the direction where it works.
  Its own doc (`:326`–`:337`) states the problem exactly right:

  > *"An equality `digest = lo + 2^16 hi` alone is not enough over BabyBear: for small digest
  > values, `digest + p` also fits in 31 bits."*

  and closes it with `hi + slack = FIELD_HI_CANON_MAX (0x7800)`, both 15-bit; `z` an exact zero
  indicator of `slack`; and `slack = 0 ⇒ lo = 0` (since `p = 0x78000001`). Six constraints per
  lane, 48 per octet. Conclusion in the file: *"every eight-felt digest has one canonical 32-byte /
  sixteen-u16 image in the AIR."*

This means the codec is **not new work in the risky place.** The AIR-side gadget exists, is
Lean-authored, and is guard-checked. What is missing is a *designation* and the Rust side calling
it instead of re-inventing.

### 2.5 Endianness — decided, because three copies disagree

Four independent implementations of Layer L exist and they are **not** all the same map:

| Site | Order | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `circuit/src/exact_nullifier_aafi.rs:407` `raw_to_u16_le` (+ inverse `u16_le_to_raw:415`) | **LE** | **LIVE** — backs the deployed exact fields root |
| `cell/src/note.rs:201` `bytes32_to_u16_limbs` | LE | faithful-v2 note path, pre-cutover |
| `circuit/src/exact_cap_root.rs:61` `bytes32_to_u16_le` | LE | exact cap leaves, not yet the live cap root |
| `turn/src/umem.rs:1499` `bytes32_to_u16_be` | **BE** | umem V2, staged/unarmed |

**Decision: little-endian.** Three of four, the *deployed* one, and Lean's stated convention.

The BE choice in umem was **not** arbitrary and deserves an explicit answer: BE limbs make
lexicographic order on the limb vector agree with `memcmp` on the source bytes, which is what a
sorted map's bracket gadget wants. The resolution is that **order is a property of how a comparator
reads the columns, not of the codec**: a lex comparator over LE limbs reads indices `15..0` instead
of `0..15`. That is a column-index change in the Lean descriptor with **zero constraint cost**.
umem V2 is staged and unarmed, so flipping it is free — do it before it arms.

Integers keep place order (`u64 → 4 × u16` LE, `value = Σ limbᵢ · 2^16i`), which LE also gives.
One rule, no exceptions.

### 2.6 Recommendation

> **The canonical codec is `Limbs16` — 16 little-endian u16 limbs — promoted from
> `circuit/src/exact_nullifier_aafi.rs:407` (`raw_to_u16_le` / `u16_le_to_raw`) into a new
> leaf crate `dregg-codec`, together with `Digest8 = chip_squeeze(domain ‖ Limbs16(b))` as the
> only permitted fixed-width committed form. Single-felt projections of 32-byte values are
> banned at security boundaries.**

Justification, in the order the decision actually turns on:

1. **An injective 8-felt encoding is impossible** (§2.1, pigeonhole, `p^8 = 2^247.26 < 2^256`) — so
   the choice is not "8 injective vs 16 injective", it is "9+ injective, or 8 non-injective".
2. **At 16 lanes the width is free where it is spent** (§2.2, `CHIP_RATE = 16`) — the 2× objection
   dissolves against a measured constant.
3. **Where width is not free, we do not spend it** (§2.3) — committed slots carry `Digest8` at 8
   felts, the same width as today, at `2^123.63` instead of `O(1)`.
4. **16-bit is the range-check width the AIR already emits** (§2.4, `u16Ranges`, `rangePlan`).
5. **The hard in-circuit gadget already exists in Lean and is `#guard`-checked** (§2.4, `Pack8Plan`).
6. **It is already deployed** in the one place someone did this correctly (`exact_fields_root`), so
   the migration target is a *live, exercised* code path rather than a design sketch.
7. **9 × base-`p` and 11 × u24 are strictly dominated** (§2.2 table) — smaller by a width that
   costs nothing, larger by a gadget cost that does.

---

## 3. The migration

Grouped by **what a fix breaks**, which is the only grouping that determines ordering.

**The window argument, stated plainly:** nothing is deployed, the devnet ledger was already lost on
reboot, and no external party holds a receipt whose hash must remain valid. A consensus-affecting
change costs a **re-genesis, which today is free.** It will not be free later. **Every
consensus-affecting item below should land now, in one epoch, or it becomes permanent debt.** This
is the single highest-leverage scheduling fact in the document.

### Stage 0 — BYTE-SAFE. No arithmetic moves. (closes 0 wounds; unblocks all of them)

1. Create `dregg-codec` (leaf crate, no deps beyond the field): `Limbs16`, `Digest8`, `Bytes32`
   wrapper, inverse, domain-tag registry. **Additive; nothing calls it yet.**
2. Correct or delete the **~30 false doc-comments** in §6. Free, and it stops the disease
   propagating into the next author's file.
3. Delete the **11 dead encoders** (§5, grep-confirmed zero callers).
4. Rename `turn/src/rotation_witness.rs:174 fold_bytes32_to_bb_limbs` — it delegates to the
   *faithful* `bytes32_to_8_limbs`, and the name invites exactly the faithful-vs-degraded confusion
   this whole document is about. Pure naming hazard, zero behavior.
5. Land the new linter (§4) in **report-only** mode so the true site count is measured, not
   estimated.

### Stage 1 — BYTE-SAFE. Collapse duplicates without changing any byte. (closes the DRIFT class)

The ~17 implementations realize 4 arithmetics, and within each family the copies are
**byte-identical** (verified by lane 4 via `grep '0x3F) << 24'` finding 4 bit-identical F2 bodies;
by lane 6 for the ~16 F1 copies). So each family can be collapsed to **one** implementation with
**zero** value change — a pure de-duplication.

Re-point every copy at one definition per family, marked `#[deprecated]` and `#[doc(hidden)]`.
No root moves, no VK regenerates, no test fixture changes.

**This closes the reinvention class immediately**, before any risky work. After Stage 1 there are
4 encoder bodies in the tree, not 17, and Stage 2+ has 4 things to change instead of 17.

### Stage 2 — VK-AFFECTING, non-consensus. The preimage layer. (closes ~35 of ~52)

Sites where the encoder output is **absorbed into a hash** whose *committed* form is already an
8-felt root or digest. Swapping the preimage codec changes the **value** of the root — so every
KAT, differential pin, and descriptor regenerates — but **no width, no PI layout, and no state
commitment structure moves.**

Order within the stage, hardest-hit first:

| Order | Sites | Wounds |
|---|---|---|
| 2a | `cell/src/state.rs:583,1014,1054` heap leaf **value** — the only LIVE, DEPLOYED, attacker-DIRECT, O(1) site with **no** exact replacement (fields got one; heap did not) | #18/#19 class |
| 2b | `cell/src/commitment.rs:547,552` CapLeaf `target`/`breadstuff` → cut over to the **already-written** `exact_cap_root` | #24 |
| 2c | `cell/src/note.rs:315,316,443–447,573,574` note commitment/nullifier preimages → `faithful_nullifier_v2` (already in-file) | — |
| 2d | `commit/src/typed.rs:606` `compress_member` — the membership leaf for cap/adjacency/nullifier/sender-authority sets | F2 |
| 2e | `turn/src/bilateral_schedule.rs:116,483,551–591` — seven accumulator roots, PI-checked at `proof_verify.rs:2852` | F2 |
| 2f | `dregg-doc/src/ci_assurance.rs:260–262` (+ the adjacent `exit_code % p` fail→0 at `:265`) | #6 |
| 2g | `zkoracle-prove/src/{attestation.rs:48,render.rs:183,198}`, `circuit-prove/src/zkoracle_leaf_adapter.rs:176,252` | #18/#19 |
| 2h | `storage/src/bucket_commitment.rs:122`, `starbridge-apps/site-host/src/site.rs:187`, `sandstorm-bridge/src/cell.rs:60,72` — public-substrate content roots, all attacker-DIRECT O(1) | — |
| 2i | `cell/src/program/eval.rs:2822` `KeyRotationGate` — self-committed `hash_bytes(next_keys)` permits **pre-committing an alias pair**, i.e. O(1) rotation equivocation | — |
| 2j | `commit/src/poseidon2_tree.rs:632` `commitment_to_field` → `persist/note_tree`, `poseidon2_note_tree`, `intent/lib:295`, `intent/gossip` | — |
| 2k | `sel4/…/crypto-floor/src/lib.rs:159,224` — the keyed-MAC tag reduction pulls EUF-CMA to ~2^31 **inside the verified partition** | — |

### Stage 3 — VK-AFFECTING + PI GEOMETRY. The committed-slot layer. (closes ~10)

Sites where limbs sit in **PI slots or trace param columns**. Replace *limbs-in-PI* with
*`Digest8`-in-PI*. Width-neutral or narrowing; PI offsets move, descriptors regenerate.

* `bridge_action_witness.rs` (retired; former lines 159–161) — `nullifier[8] ‖ recipient[8] ‖
  destination_federation[8]`, attacker-DIRECT, and **the most consequential unknown in §7**.
* `circuit/src/effect_action_air.rs:190,231` — per-effect PI slots `[8i, 8i+8)`.
* `turn/src/executor/effect_vm_bridge.rs:104` (+24 call sites) and its byte-twin
  `sdk/src/cipherclerk.rs:6741` (+23) — the two deployed projectors. **They must move in exactly
  one commit**; a skew between them is worse than the wound.
* `turn/src/executor/effect_vm_bridge.rs:278–288` — the *third* inline clone (EmitEvent
  topic/payload). Deleted in Stage 1; called out here because its descriptor moves.
* `circuit/src/effect_vm/trace.rs:26` `canonical_id_to_felts_4` — the inline AIR twin binding
  `federation_id` / `owner_cell_id` into row-0 aux columns.
* `turn/src/executor/proof_verify.rs:626` custom-proof entry binding; `:3212` `KEY_COMMIT` teeth;
  `circuit/src/effect_vm/trace_rotated.rs:4615` the in-AIR `_4` rider.
* `dregg-doc/src/ci_assurance.rs:232,236` — `CI_PI_COUNT` / `COL_EXIT` move.
* `circuit/src/faithful8.rs` — the type wall is re-founded here (§4).

### Stage 4 — CONSENSUS-AFFECTING. One epoch, all of it, now. (closes #5/#9/#11/#20/#23/#24/#33)

Everything that moves `pre_state_hash` / `post_state_hash`, a receipt hash, or a `MapOp` key width.
**These cannot be staged relative to each other** — they share the rotated block and the descriptor
key type. One epoch, one re-genesis.

* **The `MapOp` key widening.** `metatheory/…/DescriptorIR2.lean:301–313` types `MapOp.key` as
  **one** `EmittedExpr`; `EffectVmEmitRotationV3.lean:2410` sets `key := .var col`. Widening to
  `Limbs16` changes `MapOp`, the sorted-bracket / AAFI comparators (extend `LexCompare8Emit`'s
  `lexLt8_refines` to 16), and the leaf schema. **This is Lean-authored AIR work and belongs in
  Lean** — the leaf-schema widening plus the kernel flip is the ember-gated part.
* The 1-felt accumulator **keys** that ride it: `cell/src/{nullifier_set.rs:592,
  commitment_set.rs:270, revoked_set.rs:282, shielded_note_set.rs:279}`,
  `turn/src/rotation_witness.rs:326` (`cells_root`, wound #23's *still-narrow* key — the file's own
  doc already flags it), `exec-lean/src/nullifier.rs:138`,
  `circuit/src/effect_vm/trace_rotated.rs:1459` (wound #20 — a public system-wide constant whose
  key domain is attacker-writable via `RevokeDelegation`; **the single worst site in the
  catalogue** by blast radius).
* `turn/src/umem.rs:1149,1169,1205` — V1 codec (`umem_fold_bytes_v1` / `umem_key_addr_v1` /
  `umem_val_felt_v1`) **deleted**, V2 `UAddrV2`/`UValV2` armed on the wire, endianness flipped to
  LE (§2.5). This is a live-wire move, not a staged one. `umem_witness_enabled` is
  `AtomicBool::new(true)` in all three `TurnExecutor` constructors (`turn/src/executor/mod.rs:1293`,
  `:1376`, `:1429` — the field's own doc at `:1172` says *"ON by default (the umem VK EPOCH — G4)"*),
  and `umem_cohort_proving_inputs_from` — which calls `umem_proving_inputs_from_v1` — has eight
  production call sites: `sdk/src/full_turn_proof.rs:1385,1635,1773,3586` and
  `turn-prover/src/rotation_witness.rs:443,536,629`, plus the multi-domain twin at `:725`. Its
  width-7 row layout (`key · present · value · prev_present · prev_value · prev_serial · guard`) is
  what the committed umem-cohort registries back.

  What is free until this stage runs is the V2 **encodings**, in both coordinates. `UAddrV2::from_key`
  has no production caller (pinned by
  `umem_v2_address_is_big_endian_the_one_divergence_from_the_canonical_le_codec`), so the address
  endianness flip is free. `UValV2`'s only caller — `turn/src/umem.rs`'s `admit_value_v2`, the
  producer's value-injectivity gate — only ever COMPARES `UValV2`s and never emits their limbs, so
  re-orienting the value payload is free too. **Emitting either is this stage.**
* `turn/src/rotation_witness.rs:346` `iroot` — the receipt-log MMR leaf **and** its 1-felt root.
* `turn/src/executor/proof_verify.rs:3371,3401,3412` + `verifier/src/lib.rs:466,480` +
  `turn/src/conditional.rs:816` + `node/src/mcp/proof.rs:200,204` +
  `turn-prover/src/proven_receipt.rs:126` — the turn-identity / receipt-identity binding. **Producer
  and verifier halves must land together** or every receipt check breaks.
* `turn/src/rotation_witness.rs:549` `B_PUBKEY_OCTET`; `circuit/src/poseidon2.rs:596`
  `lifecycle_payload_felt` (limb 29); `cell/src/commitment.rs:737` `canonical_to_babybear_pi`.

### Ordering rationale

Stages 0 and 1 are free and make everything after them 4× smaller. Stage 2 carries the most
security value per unit of risk — it closes ~35 of ~52 including *every* O(1)-exploitable
public-substrate site — and touches no geometry. Stage 3 is mechanical once the codec exists.
Stage 4 is the only irreversible one, so it goes last **in sequence** but must not slip **in
calendar** — it is the stage the free-re-genesis window is open for.

## 4. The wall (kind F)

### 4.1 Why `Faithful8` worked and why it was not enough

The `Faithful8` newtype (`circuit/src/faithful8.rs`) is a **correct and effective** piece of
design and the precedent to build on. Read its evidence honestly:

* It works exactly where applied. Wound #23 — a 1-felt heap root inside the consensus anchor — sat,
  in the words of its own fix comment (`turn/src/rotation_witness.rs:302`), *"three fields away
  from three siblings (`nullifier_root`/`commitments_root`/`revoked_root`) that were already
  `Faithful8`."* Three correct uses, one bare `BabyBear`, same struct, ~2^31 grind on the
  consensus anchor. **The wall's absence is what made #23 possible, and its presence is what made
  the three siblings safe.** That is as clean a natural experiment as one gets.
* The private inner field, the named-constructor discipline, and the two `compile_fail` doctests
  are all right.

**But it guards the wrong axis.** `Faithful8` was built to catch the **width** class (1 felt vs 8),
and it does. It has **no opinion whatsoever about whether those 8 felts are a hard compression or a
free-alias projection.** Its own constructor list admits the failures:

* `from_bytes32` **is** `bytes32_to_8_limbs` — family **F1**, O(1) aliasable.
* `from_canonical_key` **is** `canonical_32_to_felts_8` — family **F2**, 16 source bits discarded.
* `from_lossy_31bit_DANGER` — an explicit, named escape hatch (correctly greppable, but open).

And the module doc asserts what the constructors do not deliver: *"possession of a `Faithful8` is
evidence the value came from a faithful encoder."* For a directly-chosen preimage that is **false**,
and the type wall then **launders** it — a sink cannot distinguish an aliased octet from a faithful
one. This is the anti-launder clause realized in our own code.

Second gap, and it is where most of the remaining wounds live: **the wall covers committed VALUES
and leaves map/sort KEYS bare.** Every kind-D wound (#5, #9, #11, #20, #23's residual, #24, #33) is
a **key**, and a key is a bare `BabyBear` that no type ever guarded.

### 4.2 The replacement wall

**Three types, one crate (`dregg-codec`), and the raw byte array cannot escape any of them.**

1. **`Bytes32`** — the only carrier of a 32-byte value that is allowed to produce felts. Its
   *entire* felt-producing surface is `.limbs() -> Limbs16` and `.digest8(Domain) -> Digest8`.
   There is no `impl From<[u8;32]> for BabyBear` and no way to obtain a felt from bytes without
   naming one of the two.
2. **`Digest8`** — replaces `Faithful8`, with the constructor set **narrowed**, which is the whole
   point: `from_limbs16` (chip squeeze), `from_root8` (crate-private tree folds),
   `from_wire_commit{,_chip}`, `ZERO`. **`from_bytes32`, `from_canonical_key`, and
   `from_lossy_31bit_DANGER` are deleted, not deprecated.** A wall with an escape hatch is a
   convention.
3. **`MapKey`** — **new, and the gap `Faithful8` never covered.** Every accumulator / sorted-map /
   heap / umem key parameter takes `MapKey` (a `Limbs16` newtype carrying its lex order), never a
   bare `BabyBear`. This is the type that would have made #20 and #23's residual unrepresentable.

Additionally: `BabyBear::{encode_hash, from_bytes_packed, decode_hash, from_bytes}` become
crate-private to `dregg-codec` or are deleted (§5). They are the raw material of family F1 and
there is no legitimate caller outside the codec.

### 4.3 What the linter must catch that no type can

A type wall cannot see **arithmetic**. Nothing stops an author writing
`BabyBear::new(u32::from_le_bytes([b[0],b[1],b[2],b[3]]))` inline — that is precisely how ~17
implementations came to exist, and it is a type-correct expression. So the linter's job is the
**shape**, not the name:

| # | Pattern | Catches |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | `BabyBear::new($X)` where `$X` derives from `u32::from_{le,be}_bytes` / `% BABYBEAR_P` on byte-derived data | **F1 reinvention** — the root of 3 of 4 families |
| L2 | `& 0x3F`, `& 0x7FFF_FFFF`, or any mask applied between bytes and a felt | **F2 reinvention** (bit-discard) |
| L3 | a loop or `array::from_fn` whose body indexes a `[u8; _]` and constructs a felt | **any** new byte→felt map, named or not |
| L4 | `.as_u32()` / `felt.0` narrowing back to bytes within a function that also touches a commitment/PI symbol | felt→byte laundering |
| L5 | a bare `BabyBear` in a struct field or fn parameter named `*_key`, `*_addr`, `*_root`, `*_commit`, `*_nullifier`, `*_id` | **the kind-D key class** the type wall is being added for — belt-and-braces during migration |
| L6 | the words `injective`, `bijection`, `collision-resistant`, `binds the full`, `~256-bit`, `measure-zero` within N lines of a felt-producing `fn` | **the false-doc class itself** (§6) — 30 instances say this is worth automating |

**Why `scripts/check-no-degraded-felt.sh` must be replaced, not extended.** Read against its own
text, three structural limits:

1. **It scans 3 files.** `SCOPED_PATHS = {cell/src/commitment.rs, turn/src/rotation_witness.rs,
   circuit/src/effect_vm/trace_rotated.rs}` — 3 of ~14 crates containing security sites.
2. **It matches one symbol name** (`fold_bytes32_to_bb`) — family **F4 only**, which is 109 of
   ~900 references. F1, F2, and F3 are entirely invisible to it, and **F1 is the seed of three
   families.**
3. **Its scoping rationale is itself the wound.** The rule declares the executor/SDK projectors and
   accumulator keys *"sound THERE"* — a judgment about the **root** position (faithful root8) that
   does **not** hold for the **key** the leaves fold. That is exactly the #5/#20 class, excluded by
   the gate's own comment.

It is a **symbol blocklist**. A blocklist cannot catch a *new name* for the *same arithmetic*,
which is the exact failure mode that produced ~17 implementations.

**The replacement is an allowlist gate:** *no byte→felt arithmetic may appear anywhere in the
repository outside `dregg-codec/src/limbs.rs`.* Repo-wide by default, matching on shape (L1–L3),
with a single-file allowlist and per-line `ast-grep-ignore` justification for genuine residuals —
the pattern the current script already gets right. Two properties worth keeping from the existing
script and one to add:

* **Keep:** it FATALs (exit 2) if a scoped path vanishes, refusing to report green having scanned
  nothing. That instinct is correct and should be preserved as *"FATAL if the allowlisted codec
  file is missing."*
* **Keep:** inline `ast-grep-ignore` with a mandatory human reason on the line above.
* **Add:** the gate must print **how many files it scanned and how many patterns matched**, so a
  green that scanned nothing is visibly distinguishable from a green that scanned everything.

Finally, the wall the linter cannot build either: **the Lean side must model the byte→felt step.**
Today the Lean AIRs model keys and targets as *abstract felts* (`CapRootBridge.edgeLeafOf`,
`DeployedCapOpen.targetBindGate`, `DescriptorIR2.MapOp.key`), so every binding theorem holds over
the **post-encoding felt** and the encoder's non-injectivity is **invisible to the proof**. Lean
does not currently disagree with Rust — both encode the same non-injective map, which is why the
census found no accept-divergence — but Lean also cannot *see* the wound. `Limbs16` +
`Pack8Plan` (§2.4) is what lets the Lean model finally quantify over the **bytes**.

## 5. The deletions

Standing rule: go unadditive. Each of these is **deleted and rewired**, not deprecated behind a
flag. Named with its last consumer so the rewire is a bounded task.

### Deleted immediately (Stage 0 — dead, grep-confirmed zero callers)

| Encoder | Last state |
|---|---|
| `turn/src/executor/proof_verify.rs:2678,2723` `expected_notespend_nullifier_bb` / `expected_notecreate_commitment_bb` | `#[allow(dead_code)]`, zero callers |
| `turn/src/executor/proof_verify.rs:2759,2777` `expected_burn_target_limbs` | `#[allow(dead_code)]`, zero callers |
| `commit/src/poseidon2_tree.rs:643` `hash_bytes_to_field` | test + re-export only |
| `turn/src/rotation_witness.rs:254` `root_felt` | production callers already on the wide path; only a shift-assertion references it |
| `bridge/src/present.rs:1027` `build_circuit_witness` (and its `:1058` fold) | `#[allow(dead_code)]` legacy linear path |
| `cell/src/state.rs:464` `fields_root_leaves` fold | superseded by the exact-u16 V2 path |

### Deleted in Stage 1 — duplicate bodies (byte-identical; collapse is value-preserving)

**Family F1 (~16 copies → 0).** `circuit/src/field.rs:212` `BabyBear::encode_hash`; `:194`
`from_bytes_packed`; `:222` `decode_hash` (lossy inverse — its existence invites round-tripping a
non-injective map); `circuit/src/effect_vm/helpers.rs:37` `bytes32_to_8_limbs`;
`bridge_action_witness.rs` (retired; former line 125) and `circuit/src/effect_action_air.rs:151` `encode_hash`;
`cell/src/note.rs:176` `bytes32_to_limbs`; `circuit/src/note_spending_witness.rs:365`
`bytes32_to_limbs` + `key_to_field_elements`; `turn/src/action.rs`
`stark_delegation_bytes32_to_babybear` (this list said `action.rs:576` under `cell/src/`; the crate was wrong
and the body has since been collapsed into `circuit/src/effect_vm/helpers.rs`); the three nested `bytes32_to_8_felts` clones at
`turn/src/executor/effect_vm_bridge.rs:278`, `sdk/src/cipherclerk.rs:6750`,
`node/src/mcp/proof.rs:560`; `cell/src/commitment.rs:1447` `bytes32_to_felt8`;
`bridge/src/present.rs:1760` `bytes_to_babybear_vec`.
*Last consumers:* the two deployed projectors (`effect_vm_bridge.rs:104`, `cipherclerk.rs:6741`)
and `Faithful8::from_bytes32`.

**Family F2 (~5 copies → 0).** `commit/src/typed.rs:565` `canonical_32_to_felts_8` and `:618` `_4`;
`storage/src/commitment.rs:512` (byte-identical cross-crate duplicate);
`cell/src/commitment.rs:737` `canonical_to_babybear_pi`; `circuit/src/effect_vm/trace.rs:26`
`canonical_id_to_felts_4` (inline AIR twin).
*Last consumers:* `Faithful8::from_canonical_key`, `compress_member`, the turn-identity PI path.

**Family F3 (~10 copies → 0).** `circuit/src/cap_root.rs:254` `fold_bytes32` + `encode_breadstuff`;
`bridge/src/present.rs:1766` `bytes_to_babybear`; `sdk/src/cipherclerk.rs:4803` twin;
`commit/src/poseidon2_tree.rs:632` `commitment_to_field`; `sdk/src/privacy.rs:625`
`revocation_hash_to_field`; `turn/src/executor/apply.rs:2323` nested `compress`;
`dsl/deco_payment.rs:95` and `dsl/note_spending.rs:793` inline folds; `intent/src/lib.rs:554`
inline; `circuit/src/openable_fields_root.rs:556` `fold_value32` (legacy v1, superseded in-file by
`ExactFieldsLeaf`); `circuit/src/poseidon2.rs:566` `hash_bytes`.

**Family F4 (1 body, ~100 references).** `circuit/src/effect_vm/helpers.rs:167`
`fold_bytes32_to_bb` — **the worst arithmetic in the tree** (an onto F_p-linear form: *both* a
collision *and* a hit on any chosen target felt are one linear solve). The repo's own test
`circuit/tests/effects_hash_fold_and_burn_target_width.rs:95`
(`fold_bytes32_to_bb_collides_in_o1_because_it_is_linear`) already exhibits the constructor.
*Last consumers:* the 4 `accumulator_leaf` key sites, both projectors,
`node/src/turn_proving.rs:1079` `nullifier_to_field`, `trace_rotated.rs:1459`.

**Narrow-4-byte projectors — CLOSED, and the entry mis-priced them.** They did not discard
28 bytes, they discarded 32: all of them took `u32::from_le_bytes(v[0..4])`, while
`dregg_cell::field_from_u64` writes its payload BIG-endian into `v[24..32]`
(`cell/src/program/eval.rs:3052`). Bytes 0..4 of a canonical field value are identically
zero, so every such value projected to the *same felt* `0`. The right frame is not
narrowness but SKEW: the deployed producers (`turn/src/executor/effect_vm_bridge.rs:94`
and `sdk/src/cipherclerk.rs:6823`, byte-identical to each other) use `field_limbs8(v)[0]`
= `from_be_bytes(v[28..32])`, the lo32 of the kernel u64 lane. Collision cost was FREE
(plain truncation, no search) and in practice already total.

The catalogue's own three entries were also off. Two live sites it MISSED:
`node/src/mcp/proof.rs:243` `project_effects_for_mcp` and `node/src/api.rs:3459`
`http_project_effects` (the live `/api/turns/submit` gate) — all now on
`field_limbs8(v)[0]`. And one entry that never existed: there is no `fe_to_bb` in
`storage/` in any commit. The nearest real function there is
`storage/src/commitment.rs:475` `tag_hash_31` (duplicated at `commit/src/typed.rs:518`),
which truncates BLAKE3 of a **compile-time constant** `T::DOMAIN` string to 31 bits — a
domain separator over a fixed finite input set that no adversary chooses. Benign, and not
this class; delete it from the list rather than "fixing" it.

`turn/src/executor/mod.rs:182` `fe_to_bb` carried a false doc-comment claiming
its lane was "used everywhere else by the Effect VM's state column truncation" — its
operands are compared *directly* against `initial_fields`/`final_fields`, which carry
`field_limbs8[0]`, so `FieldGte` re-evaluated as `new >= 0`, a gate that could not go red.
No deployed byte moved (the mcp sites feed the RETIRED v1 material; the api.rs site has
only `.is_empty()` read; nothing sets `EffectVmContext::slot_caveat_count`). Teeth:
`node/src/mcp/proof.rs` `setfield_value_lane_tooth`,
`node/src/api.rs::tests::http_project_effects_uses_the_deployed_setfield_lane`,
`turn/tests/caveat_operand_lane_parity.rs` — each also pins the surviving one-felt
ceiling, which is Stage 2/4 work, not a projector bug.

**Redundant *correct* codecs (keep exactly one).** Delete `cell/src/note.rs:201`
`bytes32_to_u16_limbs`, `circuit/src/exact_cap_root.rs:61` `bytes32_to_u16_le`,
`turn/src/umem.rs:1499` `bytes32_to_u16_be`; **promote**
`circuit/src/exact_nullifier_aafi.rs:407` `raw_to_u16_le` / `:415` `u16_le_to_raw` into
`dregg-codec`. Also delete the injective-but-fifth-codec 3-byte `encode_bytes_to_felts`
(`commit/src/typed.rs:531` **and** `storage/src/commitment.rs:482` — even the correct answers were
duplicated).

**Kept, re-founded.** `circuit/src/effect_vm/helpers.rs` `field_limbs8` — its lane-0-first
order is deployed protocol ABI for the welded rotated limbs and its doc-comment correctly warns of
the lane-order hazard. It becomes a *view* over `Limbs16` in `dregg-codec`, not a separate encoder.

⚑ **UPDATE 2026-07-30 — it is no longer a lane-reordering of F1, and the census table above is
annotated accordingly.** Lanes 0/1 are still the byte-swapped F1 tail (deployed ABI, unmoved), but
lanes 2..7 stopped being six `u32 % p` chunks over bytes `0..24` and now carry the leading six felts
of `hash_many_8` over `exact_nullifier_aafi::field_value_preimage` — the domain-tagged, INJECTIVE
16 × u16-LE preimage, i.e. F5 already. The chunk form was the `O(1)` alias on the only octet in the
rotated commitment with no byte-exact companion (`turn/tests/fields_octet_aliases_at_the_anchor.rs`
is the exhibit, now a regression pin). The Stage-2 endpoint is unchanged and is what half of this
function already does: the remaining work is lanes 0/1, which cannot move without a VK epoch.
Priced honestly: second preimage ≈ 2^185, **collision ≈ 2^92.7** (six lanes = 185.4 bits of image;
lanes 0/1 are free for an attacker to match) — below the ~124-bit bar, so not the end state.

**Deletion tally: ~34 encoder bodies and 11 dead functions removed; 1 canonical codec remains.**

---

## 6. The false doc-comments

Every one of these asserts a property the code does not have, and each was written in good faith by
someone reasoning about their own site. They are listed for **correction or deletion in Stage 0**,
because a false comment is how the next author inherits the mistake.

**Asserted injectivity / bijection (flatly false):**

| Location | Claim | Reality |
|---|---|---|
| `storage/src/commitment.rs:429` | *"via the fixed `canonical_32_to_felts_4` **BIJECTION**"* | lossy fold over a 16-bit-discarded octet. **The same file at `:283–284` correctly says "NOT a bijection"** — it self-contradicts |
| `app-framework/src/blinded_endpoint.rs:260` | *"the fixed `canonical_32_to_felts_4` **BIJECTION**"* | same non-bijective fold |
| `cell/src/note.rs:164–174` | *"two 32-byte values differing in ANY byte produce a distinct limb vector … **measure-zero**"* | the alias set is **53.1%** of the chunk space — the exact opposite of measure-zero |
| `circuit/src/note_spending_witness.rs:358–363` | same distinctness claim, alias set mischaracterized | ditto |
| `cell/src/commitment.rs:729–737` | *"30-bit truncation … guarantee a **unique encoding**"* | true about mod-`p`, false overall: 16 bits are discarded |
| `circuit-prove/src/zkoracle_leaf_adapter.rs:62` | *"byte↔limb packing **injectivity**"* | `from_bytes_packed` is the mod-`p` alias map |

**Asserted ~256-bit / full-value binding (overstated):**

| Location | Claim | Reality |
|---|---|---|
| `circuit/src/faithful8.rs:3–5,22–24,77,81,92–95` | *"~124-bit binding"*, *"possession of a `Faithful8` is evidence the value came from a **faithful** encoder"* | `from_bytes32` **is** `bytes32_to_8_limbs` (F1). **The wall launders the alias** — §4.1 |
| `circuit/src/faithful8.rs:126–138` | *"240 bits, faithful"* for `from_canonical_key` | 240 is the **image** size; 16 **source** bits are unbound and second-preimage is O(1) for a direct input |

`fold_bytes32_to_bb_limbs` delegates to the **faithful** `bytes32_to_8_limbs`. Rename in Stage 0.

**Correct comments worth preserving as the model** — these authors got it exactly right and the
new codec's doc should read like them: `commit/src/poseidon2_tree.rs:90–92` (*"identifies a raw
chunk `x` with `x+p`"*); `storage/src/commitment.rs:283–284` (*"NOT a bijection … one-way map"*)
and `:972` (the `0x3F` bits are *"unbound"*); `turn/src/rotation_witness.rs:302` (the `cells_root`
*"⚑ STILL NARROW"* note, which flags its own residual and names the wound class);
`circuit/src/effect_vm/helpers.rs:110–118` (the `field_limbs8` LANE-ORDER HAZARD warning);
`circuit/src/openable_fields_root.rs:458` (the concrete `0x0800_0000 + p = 0x8000_0001` alias
canary); and `metatheory/…/CommitFaithfulRegrounded.lean`, which explicitly **removed** an
injectivity assumption rather than carrying it.

## 7. Honest unknowns

Nothing below is settled by this document. Each is stated with the specific thing that would
settle it.

1. **Is `bridge_action_witness` a soundness break or an availability break?** The census's uniform
   finding is that collisions *over-include* (both sides project identically ⇒ an honest turn goes
   UNSAT), which is availability. But the former `bridge_action_witness.rs` lines 159–161 PIs
   `recipient` and `destination_federation` alongside the nullifier, and a colliding **recipient**
   would mean one bridge proof authorizes payment to either of two addresses — that is a genuine
   soundness break, not denial. **Settle:** construct the `+p` alias pair, run the prover, and check
   whether both recipients verify against one PI vector. **This is the single highest-value
   falsifier in the plan and it should run before Stage 2 scheduling.**
2. **Which nullifier path the live executor commits** — `cell/src/note.rs:315` (single-felt) or
   `faithful_nullifier_v2` (8-felt, same file). Two lanes could not resolve it. **Settle:** read
   the executor commit path end-to-end, or run the note-spend differential and observe which value
   lands in limb 26.
3. **Deployment status of the public-substrate crates** — `sandstorm-bridge`, `storage`,
   `starbridge-apps/site-host`. They emit commitments a self-verifying reader trusts, but whether
   they sit on the ledger consensus path (Stage 4) or off it (Stage 2) is unconfirmed and changes
   their stage. **Settle:** trace their roots to a receipt or confirm they terminate at a served
   artifact.
4. **`wasm/src/lib.rs:609,1810+`** — the code says *"in a real system this would be a STARK"* and
   returns a size **estimate**, so the ring path is probably a JS demo, but `fact_hash =
   hash_bytes(attribute_key)` is attacker-direct and SECURITY-shaped if live. **Settle:** confirm
   whether any verifier consumes it.
5. **Which "exact-u16" paths are live vs staged.** `exact_fields_root` is live; `exact_cap_root`
   and umem V2 appear staged. The Stage 2b/Stage 4 split depends on this. **Settle:** check the
   arming flags (`umem_witness_enabled` and the cap-root selection) and the staged registry.
6. **In-AIR range-check cost at scale.** One descriptor's `rangePlan.length == 132`. Sixteen u16
   checks per 32-byte value across every migrated site is a real trace cost that this document has
   **not** measured — only argued is cheaper than the alternatives. **Settle:** emit the migrated
   descriptors and measure trace width and constraint degree against HEAD.
7. **Whether `Digest8`'s 2^123.63 is the right target.** The deployed FRI posture is
   [[project-fri-soundness-reality]]'s **57 calculator bits**, so after this migration the codec is
   emphatically **no longer the binding constraint** — which is the correct outcome, but it means
   "we fixed the encoder" must not be described as "we fixed the soundness." **Settle:** the FRI
   correlated-agreement campaign, not this one.
8. **Whether any deployed root is genuinely consensus-anchored vs merely KAT-pinned.** Stage 2's
   claim to be "non-consensus" rests on this distinction and it was not exhaustively enumerated.
   **Settle:** enumerate the differential pins and classify each as fixture vs anchor.
9. **The census is a source read.** Six lanes read arithmetic; **no exploit was executed and no
   build was run.** Every collision cost above is derived from source, corroborated by two in-tree
   canaries (`exact_cap_root.rs:505` for the mod-`p` alias, and
   `effects_hash_fold_and_burn_target_width.rs:95` for the linear fold). **Settle:** the Stage 0
   linter in report-only mode gives a measured site count, and unknown #1's falsifier gives a
   measured exploit.

Two lane-reported items that are **not** unknowns but are worth carrying forward as work:
`sdk/tests/sovereign_rotated_wide.rs:374` may be type-stale (`fields_root_leaves` returning
`Vec<HeapLeaf>` into a parameter now wanting `&[ExactFieldsLeaf]`) — compile-confirm during
Stage 0; and `dregg-doc/src/ci_assurance.rs:265`'s `exit_code % p` aliasing failure→0 (wound #6) is
adjacent to Stage 2f and should ride with it.

## Appendix — the one-paragraph version

There is no canonical byte→felt codec, so seventeen were written, realizing four arithmetics, each
non-injective in a different way; that is why thirty-three wound entries look like thirty-three
problems. An injective eight-felt encoding is impossible (`p^8 = 2^247.26 < 2^256`), so the codec
splits in two: **`Limbs16`**, sixteen little-endian u16 limbs, injective by construction, costing
exactly one chip absorb because `CHIP_RATE = 16`; and **`Digest8`**, the Poseidon2 squeeze over
those limbs, eight felts wide — the same width deployed today — at `2^123.63` instead of `O(1)`.
The Lean AIR already contains the limb layout, the 16-bit range plans, and the canonicity gate,
`#guard`-checked. Migration runs byte-safe → VK-affecting → consensus-affecting, and the
consensus-affecting stage should land **now**, while a re-genesis is free. The wall becomes three
types with `MapKey` covering the keys `Faithful8` never guarded, and the linter matches
**arithmetic shape repo-wide** instead of one symbol name in three files. Thirty-four encoder
bodies are deleted. Roughly twenty sites are O(1)-exploitable today; none is a *demonstrated*
soundness break — the realized class is availability with occasionally global blast radius — and
the one candidate that might be worse (`bridge_action_witness`'s recipient aliasing) has a
falsifier waiting in §7.
