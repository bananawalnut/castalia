# VK-REGEN CONTROLS — misuse-resistant guardrails around descriptor/VK regeneration

Regenerating the circuit descriptors **re-keys the live federation**: the AIR
fingerprint of the deployed Effect VM descriptor feeds the recursive VK hash
(`compute_recursive_vk_hash`, `circuit-prove/src/recursive_witness_bundle.rs:135-172`),
every verifier pins that hash (`lookup_recursive_vk`,
`circuit-prove/src/recursive_witness_bundle.rs:180-186`; rejection at
`verifier/src/lib.rs:773-775`; the pin's tooth is
`foreign_circuit_root_is_refused_by_vk_pin`,
`circuit-prove/tests/ivc_turn_chain_rotated.rs:606`), and "distributing the new
VK to light clients" is a `git push` + client rebuild
(`docs/HANDOFF-v13-VK-EPOCH.md` §1c). Until now the epoch flip was gated only by
**convention** (ember-by-hand). This note records the actual regen lifecycle as
found, the four controls, and what is implemented.

## 1. The regen lifecycle as it exists

| Step | Where |
|---|---|
| Source of truth | Lean emitters, `metatheory/Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/*.lean` (the `EMITTERS` list in `scripts/emit_descriptors.py`) |
| Regen command | `scripts/emit-descriptors.sh:1-23` → `scripts/emit_descriptors.py` — runs `lake env lean --run` per emitter, routes stdout into `circuit/descriptors/*.{json,tsv}`, re-pins the `*_FP` sha256 constants in five Rust files (the `GUARDED` list, `scripts/check-descriptor-drift.sh:40-47`) |
| Freshness gate | `scripts/check-descriptor-drift.sh` (regenerate-and-diff), run in CI as the `descriptor-drift` job in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |
| The deployed VK | Compiled into the binary: `compute_recursive_vk_hash()` = VK-v2 layered hash over program bytes (`recursive_witness_bundle.rs:103`), the AIR fingerprint of `AIR_DESCRIPTOR` (`:137`), the verifier source hash (`:123`), and the pinned Plonky3 rev (`:111`). The registry accepts exactly this one hash (`:180-186`) |
| Byte pins at rest | `*_FP` constants + `include_str!` in `circuit/src/effect_vm_descriptors.rs` etc. (self-consistency only — the drift-gate header, `check-descriptor-drift.sh:6-10`, says so plainly); the by-name predicate goldens (`circuit/src/descriptor_by_name.rs:33-40`) are additionally byte-pinned by Lean `#guard`s + `circuit-prove/tests/*_emit_gate.rs` |
| Deployment | Small descriptors and provenance are committed in-repo. The seven staged TSVs are content-addressed under `descriptors/v1/sha256/<sha256>/<filename>` in the private descriptor S3 store and hydrated only after SHA-256 verification. The flip remains push + rebuild (`docs/HANDOFF-v13-VK-EPOCH.md:54-69`). `genesis.json` carries only per-app factory VKs (`node/src/genesis.rs:365-383`), never the circuit VK |

**Who could trigger a regen before this change: anyone with a shell.**
`scripts/emit-descriptors.sh` silently rewrote the tree. **What bound a deployed
VK to its source: nothing at regen time** — no record of which
`metatheory/Dregg2` tree minted the artifacts (the closest precedent was
`dregg-lean-ffi/lean-seed.pin`, which binds `DREGG_TREE_HASH` for the Lean seed
artifact — that pattern is what control 1 generalizes). **Slip-in vectors:**
(a) a regen from a tampered or *uncommitted* Dregg2 tree — the drift gate
*blesses* any Lean change, it only checks JSON↔Lean agreement; (b) a hand-edited
descriptor+FP pair (self-consistent; caught only when CI re-derives); (c) no log
that a regen ever happened.

## 2. The four controls

### Control 1 — PROVENANCE (implemented)

Every authorized regen writes `circuit/descriptors/PROVENANCE.json`: the exact
`git rev-parse HEAD:metatheory/Dregg2` tree hash, repo HEAD, a `source_dirty`
bit, the Lean toolchain, the emitter list, operator@host, UTC, and per-file
sha256 for all emitted descriptors, the by-name goldens, and the five FP-bearing
Rust files. Anyone — CI, a federation operator pre-epoch-flip — verifies with:

```
python3 scripts/emit_descriptors.py --verify-provenance            # hashes match the stamp
python3 scripts/emit_descriptors.py --verify-provenance --strict   # + clean source, tree hash
                                                                    #   matches THIS checkout
```

No Lean toolchain needed. `--strict` refuses a stamp minted from a dirty tree
(`source_dirty=true`) or one attesting a *different* Dregg2 tree than the
checkout being deployed. Honesty note: the stamp is **tamper-evident, not
tamper-proof** — a re-stamp is itself ack-gated + audit-logged, and the stamp is
a committed file, so replacing it shows in review/`git log`. The hard edge
(future work) is federation-side: bind the stamp's hash into the epoch-flip
admission message so a node *refuses* a flip whose stamp fails `--strict`
verification, alongside the existing committee check
(`federation_id` re-derivation, `verifier/src/cross_fed.rs:415-421`). That
requires an operator signing key over the stamp — deliberately not faked here.

### Control 2 — CONFIRMATION GATE (implemented)

`scripts/emit_descriptors.py` now **buffers** the whole emission, diffs against
disk, and treats a byte-identical result as an ungated no-op (so CI's drift gate
and idempotent re-runs are untouched). A **byte-changing install refuses**
(exit 3, tree untouched) unless:

- `DREGG_VK_REGEN_ACK` equals the current `git rev-parse HEAD:metatheory/Dregg2`
  — the operator must *name the exact reviewed source tree*, so a stale shell
  export from last month's regen cannot authorize today's, and a regen can never
  happen as a silent side effect; and
- if `metatheory/Dregg2` is dirty (uncommitted/untracked Lean), additionally
  `DREGG_VK_REGEN_ALLOW_DIRTY=1` — minting from an unreviewable tree is an
  eyes-open second factor, and the stamp records `source_dirty=true` (which
  `--strict` refuses, keeping dirty mints out of the deployable path).

`scripts/check-descriptor-drift.sh` deliberately passes **no ack**: on drift it
now reports and leaves the tree untouched (previously it left the tree silently
regenerated — itself a misuse vector this closes).

### Control 3 — AUDIT TRAIL (implemented)

Every authorized install or re-stamp appends one row to the git-tracked
`docs/VK-REGEN-LOG.md`: UTC, operator@host, mode (`emit` vs `stamp-existing`),
the Dregg2 tree hash, repo HEAD, the dirty bit, and the changed files. Rows are
append-only by convention; git history is the tamper-evidence.

### Control 4 — DIFFERENTIAL: covered-relation non-regression (design only)

Before an epoch flip is accepted, show the new descriptor set covers the old:
**member-for-member, name-stable, no narrowing**. The repo already has the exact
invariant shape to reuse: the wide+umem weld's Lean `#guard` pins
("member-for-member name-stable cover · NO-NARROWING invariant: traceWidth =
host+7 ∧ piCount unchanged" — `metatheory/Dregg2.lean:637`,
`metatheory/Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/EffectVmEmitUMemWeldWide.lean`) plus the Rust
per-member weld-parity tooth. The differential generalizes that to *any*
old→new regen: parse both registries through
`circuit/src/descriptor_ir2.rs::parse_vm_descriptor2`, require (i) every old
registry key present, (ii) per-member `piCount` unchanged and PI-binding offsets
stable, (iii) trace width monotone, (iv) constraint set of the old member
embeds in the new — i.e. no capability the old VK adjudicated is silently
dropped. Proposed entry point: `scripts/emit_descriptors.py --differential
<old-git-rev>` (read the old set via `git show <rev>:circuit/descriptors/...`),
with the Lean refinement statement as the proving lane. **Not implemented** —
(iv) needs a real structured-embedding check over descriptor IR2 (or the
existing faithful-commitment/refinement machinery in
`metatheory/Dregg2/Circuit/Emit/*Refine*.lean` lifted to registry granularity),
and faking it with a name-only diff would launder regressions as green.

## 3. Operator protocol (the happy path)

1. Review + commit the Lean change under `metatheory/Dregg2/`.
2. `DREGG_VK_REGEN_ACK="$(git rev-parse HEAD:metatheory/Dregg2)" scripts/emit-descriptors.sh`
3. Review the printed change set; commit the Git-tracked descriptors + FP files
   + `PROVENANCE.json` + the `docs/VK-REGEN-LOG.md` row together. The seven
   generated staged TSV working-tree files remain ignored.
4. Push the epoch branch (`descriptor-epoch/**`) and manually dispatch
   `.github/workflows/publish-descriptors.yml`. Its protected
   `descriptor-publish` environment requires owner review; it independently
   exports the seven TSVs from Lean, requires exact agreement with committed
   provenance, publishes their content-addressed S3 objects, downloads them,
   and re-verifies every hash. Publish before rerunning code CI.
5. Consumers/federation operators: `python3 scripts/emit_descriptors.py
   --verify-provenance --strict` at the deploy rev before rebuilding/flipping.
6. CI: the `descriptor-drift` job hydrates the pinned TSVs, verifies them, and
   keeps re-deriving the complete descriptor set from Lean.

For an ordinary authorized local checkout with no epoch change, hydrate the
committed set before compiling a `dregg-circuit` consumer:

```sh
python3 scripts/descriptor_store.py fetch
python3 scripts/descriptor_store.py verify
```

`fetch` downloads into a temporary directory, validates every SHA-256 from
`PROVENANCE.json`, and only then atomically installs all seven files. Public
contributors rely on the GitHub OIDC workflow because the bucket is private.
To reproduce the publish payload without changing repository artifacts,
fingerprints, or provenance, export it to a directory outside the checkout:

```sh
python3 scripts/emit_descriptors.py --export-staged-tsv /tmp/castalia-descriptors
python3 scripts/descriptor_store.py verify --source-dir /tmp/castalia-descriptors
```

Bootstrap note: the initial committed stamp is `mode=stamp-existing` (hashed
from the on-disk set, not witnessed from an emit run) and records
`source_dirty=true` because in-flight lanes had uncommitted Lean at stamp time.
The first authorized `emit`-mode regen on a clean tree replaces it with a
witnessed, strict-clean stamp.

Exit codes: `0` ok/no-op · `1` routing/verify failure · `2` emitter failed ·
`3` regen refused (unauthorized byte-changing install; tree untouched).
