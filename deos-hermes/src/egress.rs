//! THE STRUCTURED EGRESS DOOR — the ONE cap-gated, off-by-default, revocable way
//! a jailed agent reaches a SPECIFIC outside resource.
//!
//! ## Why this exists (the third leg of dregg-as-host)
//!
//! The jail ([`crate::confined`]) denies the agent ALL ambient authority: its own
//! base shell / file tools hit the OS sandbox walls and go inert. dregg's tools
//! ([`crate::mcp_server`]) are then the agent's only *effective* effect-path —
//! but they route to OUR containers (a deos-js World, a confined PD), never the
//! host. So by construction the jailed agent has NO reach to the real outside.
//!
//! That total denial is the safe default, but a USEFUL agent sometimes must touch
//! one specific external thing (a project directory, a docs tree). The structured
//! egress is exactly that and nothing more: a HOST-granted [`EgressGrant`] naming
//! ONE host path (or, later, one endpoint), read-only, that the host threads into
//! the jail's sandbox profile as a single SBPL/Landlock allow-rule. Everything
//! else stays denied.
//!
//! ## The three load-bearing properties (each provable by running)
//!
//!   1. **Off by default.** A jail launched with [`EgressPolicy::sealed`] (the
//!      default) carries no grant → the sandbox profile is the Endpoint-only jail
//!      → the granted path is DENIED inside the PD exactly like any other path.
//!   2. **Granted = a specific door, not a hole.** [`EgressPolicy::grant_read`]
//!      names ONE subpath. Inside the PD that subpath becomes readable; a SIBLING
//!      path (outside the grant) stays denied. The door is to a specific resource,
//!      not "the filesystem".
//!   3. **Revocable.** [`EgressPolicy::revoke`] drops the grant; the NEXT jail
//!      launched under the policy is sealed again. A grant is a capability the
//!      host holds and can take back — it never becomes ambient.
//!
//! The grant is consulted by the host when it builds the confined PD's
//! [`Confinement`](dregg_firmament::sandbox::Confinement) (via
//! [`EgressPolicy::confinement_for`]); the agent never mints its own egress.
