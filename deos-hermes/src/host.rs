//! DREGG-AS-HOST — the polarity inversion. dregg hosts the agent; the agent does
//! NOT host dregg.
//!
//! ## The polarity problem this fixes
//!
//! In [`crate::mcp_server`] (the prior slice) dregg's tools are registered INTO
//! hermes-acp's ACP session: hermes is the host, dregg's tools are guests added
//! alongside hermes's OWN base `[hermes-acp]` tools — and those base tools (an
//! unconfined `terminal` / `write_file`) are the leak. The authority gate
//! ([`crate::bridge`]) confines them at the *authority* face, but the agent
//! process itself still runs with full ambient OS authority.
//!
//! [`DreggHost`] inverts it. dregg is the host:
//!
//!   1. **The agent runs inside a dregg jail.** [`DreggHost::run_hosted_agent`]
//!      spawns the agent body INSIDE a confined firmament PD ([`crate::confined`])
//!      whose OS sandbox DENIES ambient file / exec / network and every inherited
//!      fd. The agent's ONLY channel is its firmament Endpoint — the dregg control
//!      channel. hermes's own base shell/file tools, run in this process, hit the
//!      jail walls (`open` denied, `socket` denied, `execve` denied) and go INERT.
//!      We do NOT fork hermes: the OS jail neutralizes the leaky base tools at the
//!      OS level, whatever the agent's tool table says.
//!   2. **dregg's tools are the only effective effect-path.** Inside the jail the
//!      agent's only way to *cause* anything is to send a dregg request over the
//!      Endpoint; the host routes it through [`crate::McpToolHost`] (cap-gated,
//!      receipted; `run_js` → a deos-js World, `terminal` → a nested confined PD).
//!      Every effect lands in OUR container, never the host.
//!   3. **Egress is a structured, opt-in door.** The host holds an
//!      [`EgressPolicy`]; sealed by default (no reach outside). When it grants a
//!      specific host subpath, THAT path — and only that path — becomes readable
//!      inside the jail (threaded into the sandbox profile). Revocable.
//!
//! ## What is REAL vs STAND-IN (honest)
//!
//! REAL: the JAIL (the OS sandbox — file/net/exec/fd denied, proven by the in-PD
//! probes), the EGRESS door (a granted host path readable, a sibling denied, both
//! proven in-PD), and the dregg TOOL effect-path (cap-gated, receipted turns
//! through [`crate::McpToolHost`], asserted on its tape).
//!
//! STAND-IN: the agent's BRAIN. A live `hermes-acp` subprocess cannot be the jail
//! body — a maximally-confined PD denies `execve`, so it cannot host a process
//! that `execve`s a python venv, AND the venv here is broken
//! (`ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'acp'`). So the body is a faithful
//! scripted agent that does what a jailed brain's tool-loop would: it REACHES for
//! its base tools (an unconfined shell, a host-FS read, an arbitrary socket) — and
//! the jail denies every one — then reaches the granted egress path (admitted iff
//! granted). The brain is stood-in; the confinement, the effect-path, and the door
//! are real. THE EXACT REMAINING WIRE: compile hermes's agent loop into the PD
//! body (or grant `execve` of exactly the agent image), so the live brain runs
//! where the scripted body runs today. Everything around it is built.
