//! The credential itself: an ed25519 block chain whose blocks carry caveats.
//!
//! ## The shape (and its Lean counterparts)
//!
//! A [`Credential`] is a nonce plus an append-only chain of blocks. Each block
//! carries (a) the caveats it installs and (b) the verification key under which
//! the *next* block's signature is checked; the root block's signature is
//! checked under the issuer's key. This is exactly the biscuit public-key
//! delegation chain of `Dregg2.Authority.BiscuitGraph` (block `n+1` verifies
//! under block `n`'s `vkey`; offline attenuation by anyone holding the tail
//! key), and the caveat semantics are `Dregg2.Authority.Caveat`:
//!
//! * **admit = the meet**: a credential admits a request iff *all* caveats of
//!   *all* blocks are satisfied — `Token.admits`, fail-closed;
//! * **attenuate = append**: [`Credential::attenuate`] appends one block —
//!   `Token.attenuate`, and `attenuate_narrows`/`attenuate_subset` prove the
//!   admitted-request set can only SHRINK. There is no removal API, and the
//!   signature chain makes block removal detectable (`BiscuitGraph`'s
//!   forged-block tooth): each non-root block signs over its parent's
//!   signature, and presentation requires possession of the tail key
//!   ([`Credential::verify`] checks the carried proof key against the last
//!   block's `next_pub`), which a holder of a *narrowed* credential never has
//!   for any prefix of the chain. Amplification is inexpressible in the API
//!   and unforgeable on the wire.
//!
//! Third-party caveats follow the macaroon discharge protocol of
//! `Dregg2.Authority.MacaroonDischarge`: a [`Discharge`] is its own signed
//! object, **bound** to the exact credential it discharges via the BLAKE3 hash
//! of that credential's [tail](Credential::tail). An unbound discharge is
//! rejected unconditionally (`unbound_discharge_rejected`); a discharge bound
//! to a different credential is rejected (`binding_not_replayable_to_other_root`
//! — the no-cross-root-replay tooth that defeats "strip caveats, reuse the old
//! approval").
