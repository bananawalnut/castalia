//! `policy` — the productized grant + verifying-middleware shape, on the
//! **proven** credential core.
//!
//! This is the adoption wedge the product ladder calls L1: *auth as the gateway
//! drug.* An agent (an MCP server, a sub-agent, a CI bot) is handed a scoped,
//! time-boxed, attenuable token instead of an unscoped API key; a gateway
//! holding only the issuer's **public key** decides — offline — whether each
//! tool call is inside the grant, and logs a receipt. The polis is *pull*, never
//! *toll*: nothing here reaches a node, a wallet, a chain, or an ontology.
//!
//! ## Why this module exists (and what it supersedes)
//!
//! The crate's first cut shipped an agent-grant surface ([`crate::Grant`] /
//! [`crate::Token`], the `eb2_` biscuit/Datalog path) under [`crate::mcp`]. That
//! surface decides with *Datalog checks*. This module instead compiles a grant
//! straight onto the [`credential`](crate::credential) core, whose every
//! operation — *attenuation only narrows*, *verification is the fail-closed meet
//! of all caveats*, *missing data refuses rather than reads as false* — is the
//! machine-checked one in `metatheory/Dregg2/`. The product's headline claim
//! ("prove your agent cannot exceed the grant") is therefore literally true on
//! the path a stranger actually touches: the grant a `Policy` issues IS a proven
//! [`Credential`](crate::credential::Credential), and the gate that admits it IS
//! [`Credential::verify`](crate::credential::Credential::verify).
//!
//! ## The 60-second shape
//!
//! ```
//! use dregg_auth::policy::{Grant, Policy, Verifier, Call};
//!
//! // A root authority. Keep the secret seed; publish the public key.
//! let polis = Policy::generate();
//!
//! // Grant an agent read + pr-create, expiring at a clock reading.
//! let token = polis.issue(
//!     Grant::to("ci-bot").tools(["read", "pr-create"]).until(1_900_000_000),
//! ).unwrap().encode();
//!
//! // A gateway holding ONLY the public key admits/denies each tool call, offline.
//! let gate = Verifier::new(polis.public_key_hex());
//! let allow = gate.admit(&token, &Call::tool("read").at(1_800_000_000));
//! assert!(allow.admitted());
//! assert_eq!(allow.receipt.subject.as_deref(), Some("ci-bot"));
//!
//! let deny = gate.admit(&token, &Call::tool("delete-repo").at(1_800_000_000));
//! assert!(!deny.admitted());
//! ```
//!
//! ## How a grant becomes proven caveats
//!
//! `Grant::to("ci-bot").tools(["read","pr-create"]).until(t)` compiles to a
//! credential carrying three first-party caveats (all on the root block):
//!
//! * `subject == "ci-bot"` — the agent identity, pinned as a *checked* fact
//!   (`Pred::AttrEq`). The [`Verifier`] binds the subject from the token itself
//!   before evaluating, so this gate passes for the right agent and is
//!   recoverable for the receipt — stronger than an advisory `user()` annotation.
//! * `tool ∈ {read, pr-create}` — the tool allowlist, as the fail-closed
//!   disjunction `Pred::AnyOf([AttrEq{tool,read}, AttrEq{tool,pr-create}])`
//!   (the empty allowlist is `AnyOf([])`, which *refuses* — you cannot mint an
//!   unscoped agent token).
//! * `clock ≤ until` — the expiry, as `Pred::NotAfter` (downward-closed:
//!   once expired, every check refuses).
//!
//! Narrowing ([`Policy`]-free, holder-side) is [`Grant::attenuate_token`]: it
//! appends a confining block (a tighter tool allowlist and/or a tighter expiry).
//! Because the core only ever *appends*, the dropped reach is gone for good —
//! the no-amplify property, structural and unforgeable on the wire.
