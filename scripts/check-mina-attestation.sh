# check-mina-attestation.sh — RUN the Mina<->dregg Poseidon attestation zkApp.
#
# `bridge/mina-zkapp/` was a complete orphan: measured 2026-07-27,
# `grep -rn 'mina-zkapp|attestation-poc|poseidon-kat' .github/ scripts/` returned
# ZERO hits across all 26 workflows and `scripts/local-gates.sh`
# (docs/AUDIT-IMPORTER-AND-DOCS.md §3.6, F-B10). Worse, what was committed did not
# run: `tsc` failed on `src/DreggPoseidonAttestation.ts`, and the PoC that was
# reported working had run in a SCRATCH DIRECTORY at a different o1js than the one
# the tree pinned. The good cryptographic result could not go red because nothing
# ever asked it to. This row is the thing that asks.
#
# What it runs (`bridge/mina-zkapp/scripts/attestation-gate.ts`, compiled from the
# committed TypeScript by `tsc` and executed from `dist/`):
#   [0] the toolchain pin is the one the tree declares (o1js 2.15.0, node >= 20)
#   [1] o1js `Poseidon.hash` reproduces every Mina-Poseidon vector the Rust probe
#       `circuit-prove/sketches/mina-pasta-hash-probe` asserts — 9 digests, the
#       depth-2 Merkle root, and the field modulus — bit-for-bit
#   [2] a `ZkProgram` verifies a Poseidon-Merkle path IN-CIRCUIT whose public
#       input is that Rust-emitted root
#   [3] a real Pickles compile + prove + verify, with the opened leaf carried out
#   [4] a tampered sibling and a tampered public root each FAIL to prove
#   [5] the `DreggAttestedGate` zkApp deploys on a local chain, CONSUMES the
#       attestation proof recursively, and REFUSES one bound to another root
#   [6] the root anchor. TWO conditions of different kinds, and the gate keeps
#       them apart because conflating them is how a trusted key came to be
#       recorded as a fix:
#         - a PROOF OBLIGATION (`DreggAnchorStatement`): the anchored root is
#           the proof's public input, and the statement pins slot 0 of the
#           anchored tree to `Poseidon(R_bb)` for a BabyBear-Poseidon2 MMCS root
#           with a known opening. The gate checks the obligation REFUSES a root
#           with no vouch in it — an obligation that always holds is not one.
#         - a PLACEHOLDER SIGNATURE, tested as a placeholder and never called
#           authorization: a non-placeholder signer, an empty signature, a
#           signature for another transition, and a signature over a root the
#           PROOF does not claim are each refused.
#   [7] a WELL-FORMED proof of a statement its prover had no witness for is
#       refused by VERIFICATION, not by the parser — at the ZkProgram level and
#       again by moving a proof between two signed account updates, with the
#       identical bytes accepted on their own update as the control. A damaged
#       encoding is refused at DECODE, separately, so the two cannot be
#       mistaken for each other (the devnet run made exactly that mistake).
#
# Second leg (`bridge/mina-zkapp/scripts/poseidon2-babybear-rows.ts`): the
# Poseidon2-w16-BabyBear permutation as an o1js circuit, checked against the
# Lean-pinned KAT of the DEPLOYED hash, compiled and PROVED, and its rows/perm
# figure RATCHETED against the number docs/MINA-VERIFIES-DREGG-FRI-SIZE.md quotes.
#
# THIRD leg (`bridge/mina-zkapp/scripts/probe-gate.ts`) — the DREGG SIDE, in
# Rust. This gate was written Node-only and said so; the unstated consequence is
# that the half of the bridge that PRODUCES the attested root ran in no gate at
# all. `circuit-prove/sketches/mina-pasta-hash-probe`'s five tests were reachable
# only by hand, and the `merkle` subcommand that emits the deployed root ran only
# inside `npm run devnet:emit-root`, which needs devnet keys and is deliberately
# ungated. So this leg runs `cargo test --locked` in the probe crate, then the
# `merkle` subcommand end to end on leaves that cannot have been precomputed
# (domain tag + git HEAD + timestamp + 128-bit nonce), requires o1js to reproduce
# the root and all 32 siblings elementwise, and then bends the emission three
# ways to show the comparison can say no.
#
# FOURTH leg (`poseidon2-merkle-rows.ts`) — RUNG 1, the Merkle OPENING. A FRI
# verifier never buys one permutation, it buys openings, and an opening is not
# `depth x rows-per-perm`: it also pays 8 witnessed-lane range checks and 8 lane
# reductions per node, neither of which a single permutation pays, and WITHOUT
# the range checks the bound tracking the whole 2,600.5 rests on is a claim
# about unconstrained witnesses. KAT'd elementwise against the DEPLOYED Rust
# MMCS (`p2merkle`: p3 `default_babybear_poseidon2_16` +
# `TruncatedPermutation<.,2,8,16>` + `PaddingFreeSponge<.,16,8,8>`) on rows
# carrying a git HEAD, a timestamp and a 128-bit nonce. Ratchets three figures.
#
# FIFTH leg (`fri-query-rows.ts`) — RUNG 2, ONE FRI QUERY at the deployed root's
# geometry (|D^0| = 2^22, 16 arity-2 commit layers, cap_height 0). The fold
# arithmetic is KAT'd against p3's own `BinomialExtensionField<BabyBear,4>` via
# the probe's `p2fold`, one commit-phase round COMPILES and PROVES, and the
# whole query's `getRows()` is ratcheted. ⚑ Needs a 16 GB node heap (the npm
# script passes `--max-old-space-size`); o1js OOMs at the 4 GB default.
#
# SIXTH leg (`fri-challenger-rows.ts`) — RUNG 3, THE CHALLENGER, and the one
# that changes what the others mean. Rungs 1/2 walk a query at a WITNESSED index
# under WITNESSED betas: that statement says "there EXIST 19 indices at which
# this proof is consistent", and a cheating prover supplies the 19 it can
# answer. This leg builds the Fiat-Shamir function itself —
# `DuplexChallenger<BabyBear, Poseidon2BabyBear<16>, 16, 8>`, KAT'd against the
# DEPLOYED one (`p2chal`, `p2fritranscript`) on the exact schedule
# `p3_fri::verifier::verify_fri` runs — so alpha, all 16 betas, the 16-bit query
# PoW and all 19 query indices are DERIVED. Four state-machine edges each get a
# discriminating polarity, the one constraint a witness can lie about (the
# bit-split's high part) gets a lying witness and must refuse, and a 4-layer
# instance of the same schedule COMPILES and PROVES.
#
# SEVENTH leg (`fri-chain-rows.ts`) — RUNG 4, the COMMIT PHASE as ONE object:
# all 16 fold layers chained, KAT'd against p3's OWN 16-round chain (`p2chain`)
# rather than 16 calls to a one-round emitter. ⚑ That distinction is not
# academic: this leg immediately found the coset descent taking `indexBits[r]`
# where `verify_query` takes `indexBits[r+1]` — right whenever two consecutive
# index bits agree, hence right on ~half of every chain and on ALL of the
# all-zero index `getRows()` supplies. The single-round descent check, made
# deterministic and both-polarity the day before, stayed green through it,
# because one round never consumes two bits. Also carries [4b], THE SEAM: one
# program that DERIVES the index from the transcript and then walks the chain at
# it, proved on an honest witness found by fixed-point search.
#
# EIGHTH leg (`fri-deep-rows.ts`) — RUNG 6, THE DEEP QUOTIENT, and the rung that
# makes the walk a statement about dregg's trace rather than about a number.
# Every rung above starts its fold chain from `initial` — the reduced opening at
# the global max height — and in all of them it is a WITNESS. A FRI walk over a
# witnessed starting value authenticates a value the PROVER CHOSE. This leg
# computes it instead, exactly as `p3_fri::verifier::open_input` does, from the
# MMCS-opened rows, the claimed out-of-domain evaluations (ABSORBED before alpha
# is sampled, so moving one moves every challenge) and the transcript's own
# index. KAT'd against `p2deep` — p3's `open_input` over
# `BinomialExtensionField<BabyBear,4>`, including its `.inverse()`.
# ⚑ AND IT EXHIBITS THE GAP INSTEAD OF ASSERTING IT: one ZkProgram carries BOTH
# the new statement and the pre-rung-6 one, the leg PROVES a witness whose
# starting value is not the DEEP quotient under the old statement, and requires
# the new one to refuse the same public claim. ⚑ Four of `open_input`'s
# conventions are silently right on a degenerate fixture — the same shape as the
# coset-descent bug — so every fixture carries TWO heights, TWO matrices sharing
# a height across DIFFERENT batches, and multiple opening points, and each wrong
# reading is a live twin that must diverge. A FIFTH candidate twin turned out to
# be the SAME FUNCTION (`g_{L+1}^{rev(s,L+1)} == g_L^{rev(s,L)}`); it is asserted
# as an identity rather than kept as a falsifier that could never fire.
#
# NINTH leg (`air-eval-rows.ts`) — RUNG 7, the AIR CONSTRAINT EVALUATION at
# zeta. Without it the FRI walk authenticates a low-degree function that encodes
# nothing in particular. The selectors, the alpha-folded accumulator, the
# quotient-chunk recomposition and the closing equality are built and KAT'd
# against `p2air` — p3's OWN `TwoAdicMultiplicativeCoset::selectors_at_point`,
# `create_disjoint_domain`, `split_domains` and `recompose_quotient_from_chunks`
# — at four different `degree_bits`, because `Z_H` is a chain of `k` squarings
# and one `k` cannot see an off-by-one in it. ⚑ `C_i` ITSELF IS NOT BUILT and the
# constraint count `N` is NOT counted, so the price is reported as `A + N*h` with
# `A` and `h` measured and `N` named. The leg FAILS if that naming disappears.
#
# TENTH leg (`dregg-proof-verify.ts`) — THE ASSEMBLY, and the first object in
# this directory that verifies a dregg PROOF rather than a piece of one. Rungs
# 1-7 are all fed fixtures the measurement synthesised; here
# `circuit/src/bin/mina_stark_fixture.rs` mints a real one with
# `p3_uni_stark::prove` under `DreggStarkConfig` — the same permutation, MMCS,
# challenger, extension and PCS the deployed root runs, with the six FRI knobs
# turned down — and REQUIRES dregg's own verifier to accept it (and to refuse
# each bent variant) before emitting anything. One `ZkProgram` then does the
# whole of `p3_uni_stark::verify`: the STARK preamble, the opened-value
# absorption, the FRI transcript, the AIR closing equality at zeta, the DEEP
# quotient, the MMCS openings and the fold chain — 56,927 rows, inside ONE 2^16
# Pickles step, compiled + PROVED + verified, refusing seven bends and three
# wrong AIRs. ⚑ The AIR is a 3-column degree-3 FIXTURE AIR, not one of dregg's
# seven root tables; the leg says so and measures what the root would cost.
#
# ⚑ NO SKIPS. A missing `node`, a missing `npm`, a missing `cargo`, an absent or
# unpinned o1js, a type error, or a diverging vector are all FAILURES — the same
# discipline as `embedded-js` and `opentheory-importer`. ~25 min warm (the
# Rung-2/3/4/6 legs are ~14 of them: 684,726 rows is slow to BUILD, never mind
# prove, and six ZkProgram compiles run). Needs cargo for legs 3-12; no Lean.
#
# ══ TIERS ═════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
# ⚑ THE CHEAP TIER IS THE DEFAULT, AND ON THIS DIRECTORY'S OWN RECORD IT IS THE
# BETTER INSTRUMENT — not a compromise. Measured 2026-07-30, this gate was ~19
# legs / 222+ checks and its `--self-test` was ~6.5 HOURS, 56% of the entire
# default `local-gates.sh` budget for one directory. In that window the self-test
# found NOTHING. Every defect the arc actually found was found by a CHEAP
# EXHAUSTIVE OUT-OF-CIRCUIT DIFFERENTIAL, in seconds:
#   * the braid twin walks 11,303 segments and found FOUR — a full output buffer
#     on entry, `sample_bits` taking the low bits, `alpha_pow` starting at one,
#     an undefined path direction — each of which "would have compiled and proved
#     cleanly for as far as any affordable run reaches";
#   * the uniform checker walks 820 boundaries and found ALL NINETEEN
#     block-to-block joins broken, first observable at instance 46 and sealed at
#     820, so "any affordable proof run would have been green and wrong";
#   * the o1js hash probe measured the real unit costs and settled a 200x
#     question BEFORE any Rust was written.
# An injection proves the gate CAN fire. It does not find defects. That asymmetry
# is what the tiering is built on.
#
#   --tier 0   DEFAULT. Out-of-circuit differentials, twins, plan/census
#              reproduction, pins, the injection pre-flight and the npm-script
#              coverage check. NOTHING COMPILES A CIRCUIT. Target: under a minute.
#   --tier 1   + compile and prove ONE REPRESENTATIVE INSTANCE PER FAMILY.
#              Minutes. This is the pre-merge run.
#   --tier 2   everything: every family member, the full chains, the ceiling
#              search. Hours. Nightly, or when you touched the thing.
#   --self-test  the injection suite (implies tier 2 for the legs it runs).
#   --preflight  PASS 1 of the self-test alone — every injection still MATCHES.
#                Seconds. Tier 0 runs this; it is also useful by hand.
#   --manifest   print the tier table as TSV. `check-mina-npm-coverage.sh` reads
#                it, so the tier assignment has exactly ONE source.
#
# ⚑ WHAT A TIER-0 GREEN NO LONGER IMPLIES. Nothing compiled, so no Kimchi circuit
# was shown to accept or to refuse anything: no Pickles proof was produced or
# verified, no tamper was refused BY A PROVER, no zkApp consumed anything, no row
# count was re-measured. What tier 0 does check is every twin against p3's own
# numbers, every recorded constant against its pin, and that every falsifier in
# the self-test still points at live code. Tier 1 restores one proving instance
# per family; tier 2 restores the rest. `docs/MINA-GATE-TIERS.md` has the table.

# ⚑ THE BRAID'S SLICE BUDGET IS THE SPLICE CUT, AND THE CUT IS THE EXPERIMENT.
# `[5]` chooses its cut from the slices the run PROVED, so a smaller budget is
# not a smaller version of the same test — it is a different one. Measured
# 2026-07-30: the same `friDigestBent` bend is REFUSED at the cut a 4-slice run
# picks and ACCEPTED at the cut a 1-slice run forces, same circuit, same bend.
#
# Since 2026-07-30 the leg says this itself: `[5]` is THREE-VALUED (refused /
# accepted / NOT ATTRIBUTABLE with the reason), prints the cut it chose and what
# every cut it reached could have attributed, and floors the attributed count so
# a narrower run cannot go quietly. So the tiers can now differ HONESTLY:
#
#   tier 1  the default 4-slice budget. 7 of 8 falsifiers attributed; `one
#           Merkle sibling bent` is reported NOT ATTRIBUTABLE WITHIN BUDGET,
#           because no cut below 11 closes a round its own siblings feed. That is
#           the outcome, stated, not a pass.
#   tier 2  FRIBRAID_LIMIT=12, which reaches cut 11 — the first cut in the whole
#           839-slice plan that can attribute a bent sibling — and the floor goes
#           to 8, so the eighth falsifier cannot silently stop firing. Costs
#           about twice tier 1's braid, which is nothing in a tier measured in
#           hours.
#
# 330 of the plan's 839 cuts can attribute that bend; 489 carry a sibling. The
# leg's `[2c]` censuses that at tier 0 in milliseconds.
# ⚑ THE BRAID AT TIER 0, FOR THE ONE INJECTION AIMED AT ITS CUT-RULE CENSUS. The
# self-test forces MINA_TIER=2 so that a fault in code a cheap run never reaches
# still gets exercised — the right default, and the wrong one here: `[2c]` is a
# tier-0 check that takes about a second, and running the leg's tier-2 half to
# watch it go red would cost thirteen minutes to learn nothing extra. The tier is
