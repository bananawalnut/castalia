# check-descriptor-drift.sh — THE Lean<->JSON cache-freshness GATE (CI / pre-commit).
#
# The checked-in descriptors are a CACHE of the Lean emission (Lean is the source
# of truth). This GENERATE-FRESH gate regenerates them from the verified Lean
# emission and fails if the result differs from what is checked in. This is the
# only honest Lean<->JSON guard: a `sha256(bytes) == committed-FP` rehash proves
# only that a file matches the hash committed beside it (self-consistency) — it
# CANNOT catch a committed JSON gone stale while the Lean emission moved underneath
# it. Re-deriving from Lean is the whole point; this script re-derives.
#
# Usage:  scripts/check-descriptor-drift.sh
#         scripts/check-descriptor-drift.sh --rev HEAD     # clean extract (churn-safe)
#         scripts/check-descriptor-drift.sh --rev <sha>
# Exit:   0 = no drift; nonzero = the Lean emission and the checked-in artifacts
#         disagree (run scripts/emit-descriptors.sh and commit).
#
# ── ⚑ WHY `--rev` EXISTS (added 2026-08-02) ────────────────────────────────────
# Without it this gate grades THE WORKING TREE, and in a shared tree that means ANY
# lane's uncommitted WIP can hold it down for everybody. Measured: a sibling's
# in-flight table-AIR emitter (`ExactPublicTableEmit.lean`, untracked) wrote
# `circuit/descriptors/table-airs/dregg-ir2-exact-public-v1.json` as a JSON ARRAY
# where the loader expects an OBJECT, and the gate died in the emit step —
#     emit_descriptors: ... payload is not a table-AIR JSON: '[{"name": ...
# — for a lane that needed it to confirm byte-identity and whose own change was in
# HEAD and fine. None of the failing material was in HEAD. The blocked lane
# correctly refused to "fix" someone else's mid-flight file to clear its own gate,
# and had no other move.
#
# `--rev` is that other move: materialise the revision in a DETACHED, `git status`-
# clean worktree and run the whole gate there, so another lane's churn is
# structurally irrelevant to the verdict rather than politely worked around.
# `scripts/check-guard-modules.py --rev HEAD` is the in-repo precedent and this
# mirrors its interface. It uses a WORKTREE where that one uses `git archive`,
# because this gate's tail (`check-drift-taxonomy.sh`) needs a working `git` to
# resolve its base ref — an archive extract has no `.git` and the taxonomy leg
# would "skip cleanly", i.e. silently stop being a gate.

# PREFLIGHT — the by-name ROUTING round trip. Static (parses `EmitByName.lean`'s table out
# of the source), so it runs in seconds HERE, before the multi-hour Lean build, rather than
# reporting after it. It is also the only leg of this gate that still works when the emit
# CANNOT run — and a blocked emit is exactly when a routing gap sits unnoticed: a name added
# to `byNameDescriptors` with no committed artifact behind it is invisible to the emit's
# coverage check (which walks files that EXIST, and needs the emit anyway), to
# `--verify-provenance` (same), and to the derived-coverage test in effect_vm_descriptors.rs
# (same). One such ghost lived a full day in HEAD before this preflight existed.
# The SECOND DOOR rides along in the same invocation (emit_descriptors.verify_include_targets):
# an artifact is also claimed by a Rust `include_str!`, which rustc resolves at COMPILE time, so
# an absent or untracked target is not drift — the crate does not build. The Lean door cannot see
# it, and an UNTRACKED target compiles for exactly one lane (the one that emitted it) and reds for
# every co-tenant and every fresh clone. Both shipped at once: `descriptor_by_name.rs`
# include_str'd `dfa-routing-table-exact-public-v1.json` while the artifact was uncommitted.
#
# A THIRD leg (verify_lean_imports) is the same door one language over: a committed .lean that
# imports an uncommitted module. `20b9d9a20f` is literally titled "repairs a committed tree that
# imported untracked files", and it had already recurred. Worth catching HERE rather than after the
# multi-hour build below, since that build is what the missing module breaks.
#
# A FOURTH leg (verify_workflow_refs) is the same door in the CI medium: a committed
# `.github/workflows/*.yml` step whose `run:` invokes a script nobody committed. `bash
# scripts/x.sh` with `scripts/x.sh` untracked is green on the author's box and `No such file or
# directory` on every runner and every fresh clone — and it was live the night that leg was
# written (`scripts/check-ratchet-darkness.sh` sat untracked under an uncommitted ci.yml hunk that
# ran it). It rides along here for the same reason as the other three: this is the ~1s answer, and
# without it the medium's only detector is the broken job itself, AFTER it lands.
#
# ── ⚑ AND IT DOES NOT ABORT (changed 2026-08-06) ──────────────────────────────
# This leg used to `exit 1` on a reference gap, which made it a MASK: the gate
# whose job is detecting descriptor drift would stop ~40s in, on a question that
# is not drift, and never reach the byte comparison at all. Measured: a 45-file
# descriptor drift went unreported because an unstamped-artifact preflight
# failure exited first — the reference gap was real, the drift was real, and only
# the reference gap was ever printed. One gate's cheap leg hid the other leg's
# verdict, and the cheap leg is not the one the gate is named after.
#
# So the verdict is RECORDED and the run CONTINUES. Both legs are reported at the
# end and either one fails the gate — nothing is weakened, the refusal is just no
# longer allowed to be the only thing you learn. `--fail-fast` restores the old
# abort for the case where you genuinely only want the ~40s answer.
