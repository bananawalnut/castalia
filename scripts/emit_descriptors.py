"""emit_descriptors.py — regenerate every circuit descriptor JSON from the Lean
emit (the SOURCE OF TRUTH) and re-pin the sha256 fingerprints in the Rust registry.

Lean is authoritative: the `circuit/descriptors/*.json` files and the `*_FP`
fingerprint constants are MACHINE-GENERATED projections of the verified Lean
`EffectVmDescriptor` objects. This script is the ONE command that closes the
Lean->JSON->FP loop, so the checked-in artifacts can never silently drift from
the Lean emission.

Pipeline:
  1. Run each Lean emitter executable (`lake env lean --run <file>`), capturing
     its `key<TAB>name<TAB>json` (or manifest) TSV stdout.
  2. Split each emitter's stdout into `circuit/descriptors/<file>.json` via the
     per-emitter routing below. The routing is reconstructed from the Rust
     registry tables (so it stays in lockstep with how the prover consumes them).
  3. Recompute sha256 of every emitted file and rewrite the matching `*_FP`
     constant in the Rust sources.
  4. Normalize the WHOLE Lean-authored Rust modules (`circuit/src/effect_vm/
     *_generated.rs`) through the pinned rustfmt, so the generator's bytes equal
     the bytes `scripts/git-hooks/pre-commit` and `cargo fmt --all -- --check`
     produce — the two producers cannot disagree (see normalize_generated_rust).

Idempotent: on a freshly-emitted AND fully-stamped tree it is a NO-OP (nothing is
written). "Byte-identical" alone is not enough for that — a descriptor whose bytes
already equal the emission but which PROVENANCE.json does not COVER still gets
stamped (ack-gated, mode=emit; see provenance_stamp_gap). Run
`scripts/check-descriptor-drift.sh` to GATE on drift.

MISUSE-RESISTANT REGEN GATE (docs/VK-REGEN-CONTROLS.md): regenerating a deployed
descriptor set RE-KEYS the federation (the AIR fingerprint feeds the recursive
VK hash — circuit-prove/src/recursive_witness_bundle.rs). A byte-CHANGING install
therefore refuses to proceed unless explicitly authorized:

  DREGG_VK_REGEN_ACK=<git rev-parse HEAD:metatheory/Dregg2>   (the exact source
      tree the operator reviewed; compute it with that command)
  DREGG_VK_REGEN_ALLOW_DIRTY=1   (additionally required when metatheory/Dregg2
      has uncommitted/untracked edits — an unreviewable source tree)

Authorized installs stamp circuit/descriptors/PROVENANCE.json (what source tree
minted these bytes, per-file sha256) and append a row to docs/VK-REGEN-LOG.md
(the audit trail). No-op runs (the common CI / drift-gate case) need no ack and
touch nothing.

Modes:
  (default)              emit from Lean, gate, install, stamp, log
  --stamp-existing       stamp PROVENANCE.json from the CURRENT on-disk bytes
                         (no Lean run; ack-gated + logged, for bootstrap/re-pin)
  --verify-provenance    recompute hashes vs the stamp, and refuse a stamp that
                         records source_dirty=true. `--rev <rev>` grades that
                         REVISION in a detached, `git status`-clean worktree
                         instead of whatever is lying around (the churn-safe form;
                         this is the one a shared tree can always answer).
                         --strict additionally requires the stamp's tree hash to
                         match the checkout's HEAD:metatheory/Dregg2 — a CEREMONY
                         question, red on any unrelated metatheory commit, so it
                         belongs at an epoch flip and not in a standing gate.
                         No Lean needed.
  --self-test-provenance drive --verify-provenance RED and GREEN on scratch copies
                         (mutated byte, dropped stamp row, source_dirty stamp,
                         plus the clean control). Touches nothing shared.
  --verify-by-name-routing
                         reconcile `EmitByName.lean`'s routing table against the
                         checked-in by-name/ set and the stamp, BOTH directions.
                         Static parse of the .lean — no Lean run, no cargo, seconds
                         — so it still works while the emit is blocked (which is
                         exactly when a routing gap can sit unnoticed). ALSO runs
                         all three other doors on ONE class — a COMMITTED reference
                         to an UNCOMMITTED target, which is green for its author and
                         red for every fresh checkout: every literal `include_str!`/
                         `include_bytes!` target in tracked Rust (verify_include_
                         targets), every first-party Lean `import` (verify_lean_
                         imports), and every repo path a tracked
                         `.github/workflows/*.yml` invokes (verify_workflow_refs)
                         must EXIST and be TRACKED.
  --list-emitter-modules print the Lean modules the emitters import (one per line)
                         — the set that must be `lake build`-ed for the emit to run
                         on a cold checkout. Derived from the emitters' own imports;
                         no Lean run. `check-descriptor-drift.sh` builds this.
  --list-guarded-paths   print the repo-relative paths this driver can REWRITE (one
                         per line) — `install_and_stamp`'s whole change-set: the
                         descriptor dir, the `*_FP`-bearing Rust sources, and the
                         Lean-authored `*_generated.rs` modules. No Lean run.
                         `check-descriptor-drift.sh` snapshots exactly this instead
                         of transcribing it.

#
# It used to read: "it is purely cosmetic — JSON does not care — but the bytes are FP/VK-pinned, so
# NORMALIZING the convention would re-key those 5 descriptors for a whitespace change."
#
# A descriptor's semantic fingerprint — the thing a `vk_pin` names and the thing that feeds the
# recursive VK hash — is `effect_vm_descriptor2_semantic_fingerprint(&EffectVmDescriptor2)`: it
# canonically re-encodes the PARSED descriptor and never hashes the file bytes. A trailing newline is
# discarded by the parser before the fingerprint is taken.
#
# PROVED over all 158 served descriptors, both directions (add to bare, strip from terminated), by
#   circuit/tests/vk_pin_closure_over_the_served_tree.rs
#     ::a_trailing_newline_does_not_move_a_descriptors_fingerprint
#
# So normalising the convention is a PROVENANCE RE-STAMP, not a re-key: it moves each file's sha256
# and moves no `vk_pin`, no VK and no federation key. The cost estimate that froze this set was
# pricing a flag day that does not exist.
#
# Why it must go rather than stay correct-but-cosmetic: while it stands, ONE object has TWO byte
# streams. `metatheory/MinaChainEmit.lean:48` writes `emitVmJson2 chainDesc ++ "\n"`;
# `metatheory/EmitByName.lean:788` writes the same descriptor with no trailing byte; and this table
# reconciles them per-filename. Determinism that is restored by a hand-maintained lookup of 30 names
# is not determinism, and it is the precondition for descriptors becoming build artifacts at all —
# a generated file cannot be reproducible if its producer's byte stream depends on which driver ran.
#
# THE MOVE (not done here — it needs a full regen, and this must not fire while sibling lanes hold
# `circuit/descriptors/` open):
#   1. make the payload newline-terminated UNIFORMLY at the writer in `install_and_stamp`;
#   2. drop the `blob += "\n"` special-case below and delete this frozenset;
#   3. give `EmitByName` and `MinaChainEmit` one shared writer so neither decides the convention;
#   4. re-stamp PROVENANCE.json. No VK rotation, no re-emit of any consumer.

    and `lake build` (default targets: Dregg2/Metatheory/Polis/Market) does NOT warm all
    of them. Measured at the time of writing: 17 of `EmitByName.lean`'s 26 imports are
    reachable from NO default target (the `Dregg2.Circuit.Emit.*Emit` authors under
    DfaRouting/Predicates/Presentation/… — nothing in the `Dregg2` root import closure
    pulls them in). On a cold checkout the by-name emit therefore died with 'object file
    does not exist' and `emit_descriptors.py` exited 2 — i.e. the drift gate was green
    only where an EARLIER build step, outside the gate, happened to warm the cache. The

    The stamp is an artifact this driver owns, and its obligation is not a byte diff: a descriptor
    can be byte-for-byte the Lean emission and still have NO row attesting it, which is the whole
    state PROVENANCE.json exists to make impossible. `install_and_stamp`'s `changed` list compares
    emitted bytes against disk and is structurally blind to that — so a byte-identical emission
    returned NO-OP and left the stamp short, permanently, with the ONLY escape being
    `--stamp-existing` (which re-stamps every file as a DISK re-hash, demoting `mode` from a Lean
    witness to a self-consistency check for the other 138 descriptors as the price of covering 5).
    MEASURED 2026-07-26: five tracked by-name descriptors — the four light-client verifiers and the
    DFA routing table, every one of them a live `include_str!` target in `descriptor_by_name.rs` —
    shipped unstamped while this driver printed NO-OP and exited 0.

    Compared against the EMISSION, not against disk, so a clean answer means "the stamp covers what
    Lean just emitted" rather than "the stamp is consistent with itself".

    The two DESCRIPTOR legs ONLY. `fp_file_sha256` pins SOURCE files (`effect_vm_descriptors.rs`
    among them) that legitimately change on any edit to their hand-written prose; folding that leg
    in here would demand an ack — and therefore RED the no-ack drift gate — after every unrelated
    source edit. It is a provenance snapshot, not a stable invariant, and the Rust mirror test
    (`provenance_json_pins_match_checked_in_descriptor_bytes`) excludes it for the same reason."""

# ---- the by-name ROUTING round-trip (STATIC — no Lean run) -------------------
#
# `EmitByName.lean`'s `byNameDescriptors` is the routing table for the whole
# `circuit/descriptors/by-name/` surface. Until this check, only ONE of its two
# directions was gated, and only by machinery that needs a full Lean emit:
#
#   * file-on-disk -> table: the coverage check in `main()` fails on a by-name file no
#     emitter reproduces. Needs the emit (hours of `lake build`) to say anything.
#   * table -> file-on-disk: NOTHING. A name added to the table whose artifact was never
#     committed is a GHOST — the emit would mint it, but until the emit runs the routing
#     table advertises a descriptor that does not exist, `descriptor_by_name.rs` cannot
#     serve it, and no byte-pin covers it. The `#guard byNameDescriptors.length == N` in
#     the Lean file counts the ghost as a member, so it passes. `--verify-provenance` and
#     the derived-coverage test in `circuit/src/effect_vm_descriptors.rs` both start from
#     files that EXIST, so a ghost gives them nothing to notice.
#
# This closes it from the OTHER end: parse the table's name literals out of the .lean
# source (they are string literals — no Lean toolchain needed) and reconcile them against
# the tracked/on-disk directory and the PROVENANCE stamp. It therefore keeps working while
# the emit is blocked, which is exactly when a routing gap can sit unnoticed.
#
# The parse is STRUCTURE-CHECKED, never best-effort: it must find the decl, must find the
# terminator, must produce one name per list opener, and must agree with the Lean file's
# own machine-checked `#guard byNameDescriptors.length == N`. Any of those failing is a
# loud FATAL ("the table's shape moved; re-point this parser"), never a quiet pass — same
# rule the COVERAGE_EXEMPT mirror in `circuit/src/effect_vm_descriptors.rs` follows.

# ---- THE SECOND DOOR: `include_str!` / `include_bytes!` of an artifact -------------------

# `verify_by_name_routing` above reconciles the LEAN routing table against the checked-in
# by-name set. It cannot see the other way an artifact gets claimed: a Rust
# `include_str!("../descriptors/by-name/X.json")`. That macro is resolved by rustc at COMPILE
# time, so an absent or untracked target is not a soft drift — the crate does not build, and
# every crate downstream of it does not build. Both directions of that were live at once:
#
#   * INCLUDE-GHOST — the target exists NOWHERE. An unconditional compile break for everyone.
#   * INCLUDE-UNTRACKED — the target exists on the author's disk but is not tracked by git.
#     Green for the lane that emitted it, RED for every co-tenant and every fresh clone. This
#     is the direction nothing else in the tree can see: the Lean door treats an on-disk
#     untracked artifact as "in flight" and (correctly, for ITS question) stays quiet, the
#     emit's coverage check walks files that exist, and `cargo check` on the author's box
#     passes. It shipped exactly this way — `descriptor_by_name.rs` include_str'd
#     `dfa-routing-table-exact-public-v1.json` while the artifact was uncommitted.
#
# Deliberately NOT scoped to descriptors. An absent `include_str!` target is a compile break
# whatever the file is, and scoping the class to `circuit/descriptors/` would have made the
# check a description of the one instance we happened to find rather than of the shape.
#
# Reads the WORKING TREE of tracked `*.rs` (not `HEAD:`) on purpose: the ~1s preflight in

# ---- THE FOURTH DOOR: a workflow that runs a script nobody committed ---------------------
#
# Same class as the two above, third medium. A `.github/workflows/*.yml` step whose `run:`
# invokes `bash scripts/x.sh` is a COMMITTED reference; if `scripts/x.sh` is untracked the job
# dies with `No such file or directory` on every runner and every fresh clone while the author's
# box is green. Nothing else could see it: the routing preflight covered Lean imports and
# `include_str!` targets, `actionlint` (not run here) type-checks workflow SYNTAX and does not
# resolve invoked paths against the index, and the job itself only reds AFTER it lands.
#
# Live instance the night this leg was written: `scripts/check-ratchet-darkness.sh` sat untracked
# while an uncommitted ci.yml hunk added a `ratchet-darkness` job running it. It landed correctly
# (7f52c1fac0 committed all three files) — by the author's diligence, not by detection. This is
# the detection.
#
# PARSER SHAPE, and why it is built the way it is. Workflow `run:` bodies are SHELL, so the
# question "which repo paths does this workflow execute" cannot be answered by a regex over the
# YAML: `#`-comments (both YAML and shell) carry prose full of sentence-final periods and words
# like `bash to`, heredoc bodies carry foreign languages, and half the real invocations are
# spelled across a `\` continuation. Every one of those produced a false hit on the first pass.
# So: strip comments, join continuations, drop heredoc bodies, then extract only COMMAND-POSITION
# invocations, and classify each one:
#
#   * CHECKED — a statically resolvable in-repo path. Must exist and be tracked.
#   * NOT-CHECKABLE — reported with a count and a reason, never guessed at. Five reasons, each
#     one a thing this parser genuinely cannot resolve rather than a thing it declines to look at:
#     a `$VAR`/`${{ }}`/glob in the path, a non-static `working-directory:`, a `cd` earlier in the
#     block, an absolute host/runner path (`/usr/bin/...` is not ours to track), a path the
#     workflow PRODUCES at runtime (`curl -o elan-init.sh` then `bash elan-init.sh`), a path git
#     itself declares generated (`.gitignore`d — `./target/release/dregg-node`), or a block whose
#     shell would not lex.
#
# The `include_str!` lexer's failure mode is the one to avoid here: it `sys.exit`ed on a char
# literal it misread, so two CI jobs were dying BEFORE reporting anything and looked like they
# were checking. This leg is FATAL only where a fatality is the honest answer (an unterminated
# heredoc means the block boundaries this parser computed are wrong), and every other
# can't-tell is a NAMED, COUNTED line in the summary.

def _wf_parse(path: Path, rel: str) -> list[tuple[int, str, str, list[tuple[int, str]]]]:
    """Workflow file -> [(lineno, kind, working_directory, body)] for kind in {run, uses}.

    A hand-rolled YAML SUBSET on purpose: PyYAML is not a dependency of this repo and the
    `descriptor-by-name-routing` job runs a bare `python3` with no pip step, so importing it would
    make this leg's coverage depend on whatever the runner image happens to ship. Only three keys
    are read (`run`, `uses`, `working-directory`) and only two node shapes (a `|`/`>` block scalar,
    and a plain inline scalar), which is the whole grammar GitHub's step syntax uses for them.

    `working-directory:` RELOCATES every relative path in a step, so it has to be honoured:
    `extension.yml`'s `./build.sh` under `working-directory: extension` is `extension/build.sh`,
    which is tracked — reading the key turns two would-be false hits into two real passes.

    ⚑ AND ITS SCOPE IS THE WHOLE CORRECTNESS OF THIS LEG. Measured 2026-08-01: it LEAKED. The
    old rule reset the key at any `- ` item "at or above the step's indent", with the baseline
    indent taken from the FIRST `- ` anywhere in the file — which in `ci.yml` is `- cron: '0 6 *
    * *'` at indent 4, under `on: schedule:`. Every real step is at indent 6, so `6 <= 4` never
    held and **the key was never reset again in that file**. One `working-directory: metatheory`
    at line 1471 therefore relocated EVERY subsequent step, which is where the eight
    `WORKFLOW-GHOST` findings against `metatheory/scripts/*` came from: not eight broken steps,
    one broken parser. The leak cut BOTH ways and the quiet half was worse — a
    `working-directory: ${{ matrix.dir }}` at line 442 leaked forward too, so FIFTEEN static,
    checkable invocations (`scripts/ci-mathlib-cache.sh`, `scripts/check-dark-modules.py`,
    `scripts/axiom-hygiene-guard.sh`, …) were deferred as "not static" and never checked at all.
    A permanently-noisy check trains readers to skip it, and a deferral is how it goes blind
    without ever printing a red.

    The scope is now modelled properly, in the two shapes GitHub actually has:

      * STEP level — `working-directory:` inside a step's mapping, scoped to THAT list item.
      * JOB level — `defaults: → run: → working-directory:`, which applies to every `run` step
        of the job (`extension.yml`, `forge.yml`) and dies at the next job.

    ⚠ AND IT IS RESOLVED PER ITEM, NOT IN READING ORDER. A YAML mapping is unordered and this
    repo writes it both ways — `ci.yml:192` is `- run: cargo test` with `working-directory:
    solana-lock` on the line BELOW, while `ci.yml:298` puts the key first. A parser that
    attributes the key only forwards silently drops the first shape, so the item's whole extent
    is scanned before its `run:` steps are resolved.

    `uses:` steps get NEITHER: `working-directory` is a `run` key, and `uses: ./x` resolves
    against the workspace root however the cwd was set."""

    ⚑ **The emitter existed and was never invoked.** `EmitTableAirs.lean` has been the byte source
    for `table-airs/*.json` since those artifacts landed (2026-08-01), and it was absent from
    `EMITTERS`, so the seven files were checked in with NO emitter reproducing them. Two things
    followed, and the second is the expensive one:

      * the drift gate could not see them — the checked-in bytes and the Lean emission were free to
        diverge exactly the way `by-name/predicate-arith.json` once did; and
      * the coverage check at the END of this driver counts any descriptor no emitter reproduced as
        a ROUTING GAP and refuses the whole install — so these seven blocked EVERY re-emit of every
        other descriptor, which is how a geometry flag day sat un-re-emitted.

    Unlike `by-name/`, every artifact carries a trailing newline, so there is no per-file convention
    set to keep in sync: the newline `IO.println` produces is the newline on disk.

    ⚑ **TWO PAYLOAD SHAPES, and the second is a FAMILY.** `EmitTableAirs.lean` has two routing
    tables and two renderers (`EmitTableAirs.lean:28`, `:49`): `tableAirs` renders a singleton with
    `emitTableAirJson`, and `tableAirFamilies` renders a JSON ARRAY with `emitTableAirFamilyJson`
    (`Dregg2/Circuit/TableAirIR.lean:782-793`) — the wire form of a table AIR that is a SCHEMA
    rather than one object, element `i` being arity `i + 1`. The Rust side has decoded the array
    since the same commit (`circuit/src/table_air.rs:1029` include_str!s it,
    `parse_table_air_family` walks it, `exact_public_table_air_for` selects a member).

    This guard used to be `blob.startswith('{"name":"')` — a prefix test that hard-coded the
    SINGLETON grammar. `17b138e1f` landed the family end to end (Lean renderer, artifact, Rust
    parser) and did not reach here, so the emit step exited 1 on
    `dregg-ir2-exact-public-v1.json` and took the whole drift gate down with it for every lane.
    The array is not a regression; the prefix test was the stale side.

    The replacement PARSES rather than sniffs, so it is strictly stronger than what it replaces (a
    truncated or half-flushed blob now fails too), and it still writes `blob` VERBATIM — nothing
    here reserializes, because these bytes are FP/VK-pinned."""
