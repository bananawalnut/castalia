# check-drift-taxonomy.sh — THE DRIFT-TAXONOMY CI GATE.
#
# Classifies the descriptor delta between a BASE git ref (what trunk ships today)
# and the WORKING TREE (what this change proposes), and REFUSES a GEOMETRY-WIDEN
# (a re-genesis flag-day) unless an eyes-open re-genesis flag is set. Mechanizes
# "does this upgrade need a wipe?" — a TAIL-APPEND passes cleanly; a change that
# moves an existing cohort member's trace_width / shared-PI-prefix / fingerprint
# cannot ship silently.
#
# Unlike check-descriptor-drift.sh (Lean<->JSON freshness — needs a Lean build),
# this gate is a pure diff of two committed/working descriptor sets: no toolchain
# required, cheap to run on every PR.
#
# Config (env):
#   DRIFT_TAXONOMY_BASE_REF  base ref to diff against (default: first of
#                            origin/main, main, HEAD that resolves)
#   DREGG_ALLOW_REGENESIS=1  acknowledge an eyes-open re-genesis (passes a
#                            GEOMETRY-WIDEN). The ember-gated flag.
#   DRIFT_DESCRIPTORS_SUBPATH  descriptor subpath (default circuit/descriptors)
#
# ── ⚑ `--rev` (added 2026-08-02) ───────────────────────────────────────────────
# The OLD side has always been a git ref; the NEW side was the WORKING TREE, and
# that asymmetry is the whole defect. A re-genesis verdict — "does this upgrade
# need a wipe?" — was being computed against bytes nobody chose to bless: a
# sibling mid-emit turns a TAIL-APPEND into a GEOMETRY-WIDEN for every co-tenant,
# and an uncommitted local repair hides a widen that is really in HEAD.
# `--rev <r>` materialises `<r>:$SUBPATH` with `git archive` and grades THAT, so
# both sides of the classification are commits. `check-descriptor-drift.sh --rev`
# already got this for free (it re-roots `$ROOT` into its detached worktree
# before invoking this script) — the flag is for every OTHER caller, and for the
# log line, which said "-> working tree" even when it was not one.
#
# Usage:  scripts/check-drift-taxonomy.sh
#         scripts/check-drift-taxonomy.sh --rev HEAD
# Exit: 0 = UNCHANGED / TAIL-APPEND (or GEOMETRY-WIDEN + DREGG_ALLOW_REGENESIS=1);
#       4 = GEOMETRY-WIDEN refused (no re-genesis flag); 2 = setup error.

# clone, a detached CI checkout, a `git archive` extract — it picked `HEAD` and graded HEAD against
# HEAD. `scripts/bare-clone-repro-gate.sh` builds EXACTLY that context on purpose (a fresh clone
# with no remote-tracking branch), and any consumer running `--rev HEAD` there compared a commit to
# itself: `UNCHANGED`, exit 0, forever, on any delta whatsoever. A gate whose base is its own subject
# cannot go red, and this one's whole job is to REFUSE a re-genesis.
#
# `HEAD` is gone from the chain, and the two fall-through paths below now REFUSE (exit 2, the
# setup-error code — distinct from 0 PASS and from 4 GEOMETRY-WIDEN-REFUSED) instead of `exit 0`.
# A skip that greens is indistinguishable from a check that passed, and the caller sees only the
# code.
#
# ⚠ `DRIFT_TAXONOMY_BASE_REF` is still honoured verbatim and can still be set to `HEAD` — that is a
# deliberate, typed-out choice by a caller who wants working-tree-vs-HEAD, which IS a real question.
# What is gone is arriving there by ACCIDENT, from an empty ref namespace, with nothing said.
