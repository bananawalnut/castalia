# check-lean-seed-closure.sh — does this Lean seed archive actually accelerate a build?
#
# ═══ THE WOUND THIS CLOSES (issue #41) ══════════════════════════════════════════════════
# The seed exists to turn an hours-long cold `lake` bootstrap into minutes. An outside
# reporter measured, on a fresh Linux/x86_64 bootstrap, that it does not: the installed
# base seed held 1,797 members, and the immediate `cargo build -p dregg-lean-ffi
# --features lean-lib` then had to compile and splice **1,251 further objects over 25
# closure passes — 21m47s** — arriving at a 3,085-member working archive. Promoting THAT
# archive as the seed cut a clean fail-loud `dregg-deploy` build to 2m51s and 5 objects.
# Their diagnosis was exact: the seed script and `build.rs` were computing DIFFERENT
# closures. (Fixed at the source in `ec4ed5e17`, 2026-07-29 — both now root at
# `Dregg2.FFI`, and `scripts/lean-ffi-closure.py` computes the one closure.)
#
# ⚑ Nothing in the tree compared a seed's CONTENTS to that closure, so the fix at the
# source cannot be observed from a seed. `scripts/check-lean-seed-freshness.sh` compares
# a TREE HASH recorded in `dregg-lean-ffi/lean-seed.pin`; it says nothing about what is
# in the archive. Measured 2026-07-30, the seed sitting in this checkout carried 188
# `Dregg2_*.o` against a 243-module boundary closure — **55 in-tree modules absent**,
# every one of them a verified decision (the Mina light-client gates, the circuit emit
# modules, DelegAdmit) — and did not carry `Dregg2_FFI.o`, the boundary object itself.
#
# ═══ WHY "IT SELF-LINKS" IS NOT THE BAR ════════════════════════════════════════════════
# That same 55-short archive has ZERO undefined initializers. It self-links perfectly —
# because the boundary object that would REFERENCE the 55 is missing too. An archive can
# be closed and still be missing every gate it exists to arm. So this gate checks the
# boundary FIRST and the link-closure SECOND; either alone is satisfiable by a short seed.
#
# THREE LEGS, each refutable on its own:
#   1. `Dregg2_FFI.o` is a member.  The boundary module IS the manifest (`metatheory/
#      Dregg2/FFI.lean`); its object is that manifest's compiled image. Absent ⇒ nothing
#      in the archive references the runtime closure and leg 3 is vacuous.
#   2. Every IN-TREE module of `Dregg2.FFI`'s import closure has a member. This is the
#      coverage leg: a missing one is an `@[export]` the Rust bridge will compile its
#      ABSENT arm for — green, silent, un-armed.
#   3. No undefined `initialize_*` in the archive AS A WHOLE (referenced-minus-defined,
#      the same U−T computation `dregg-lean-ffi/build.rs::undefined_initializers` runs).
#      This is the SPEED leg and it is the reporter's number: each one is an object the
#      first `cargo build` must resolve, compile and splice before it can link.
#
# Dependency (Mathlib/Batteries/…) modules are deliberately NOT required member-by-member:
# the archive is reachability-GC'd on purpose (a full warm mathlib tree is ~295 MB against
# a ~96 MB closure, docs/LEAN-SEED-SIZE.md). Leg 3 is the correct bar for them — present
# iff something actually needs them.
#
# Usage:  scripts/check-lean-seed-closure.sh [archive]      (default: dregg-lean-ffi/libdregg_lean.a)
# Exit:   0 the seed is closure-complete · 1 it is short (the delta is printed) · 2 cannot measure
