"""check-feature-tiers.py — THE FEATURE SURFACE GATE: no cargo feature is silently uncovered.

## The hole this closes

A `#[cfg(feature = "x")]` is A SUBTRACTION THAT EMITS NO LINE. A failing test prints a line; a
red build prints a line; code that is not compiled prints NOTHING. The build is green BECAUSE
the code is absent. That is a strictly worse signal than `#[ignore]`, which at least keeps the
file compiling so API drift reds the day it lands.

MEASURED 2026-07-26 on this tree: 243 `(crate, feature)` pairs across 145 distinct feature
names, declared by 73 of this repository's 270 first-party packages, spread over 8 cargo
workspaces. `cargo check --workspace` plus every `--features` flag in every PUSH-TRIGGERED
workflow activates 152 of them. NOTHING anywhere passes `--all-features`. So 91 pairs — 37% of
the surface — were compiled by no CI job at all, and produced no line saying so. Among them: the
three `#![cfg(feature = "prove")]` adversarial fold canaries (`armed-teeth.yml` arms them),
`tlsn-live` in 6 crates, `private-bazaar-live` in 4, `no-lean-link` in 2, all 13 of pg-dregg's
pgrx ABIs, and both seL4 protection-domain features.

Nine of the ten `--features` flags reachable from a workflow file are in `ci.yml` and fire on
every push. The other two things that look like coverage are not: `pages.yml` (`gpui-web`, `web`)
is `workflow_dispatch` ONLY, and `publish-sdk-py.yml` names `kernel` in a COMMENT while no step
passes it.

`private-bazaar-live` is the proof that this is not a tidiness item: a verified settling gate
shipped inside it and was never registered anywhere, and every settling test in that crate could
not go green on any host. Nobody saw it, because an uncompiled feature has no output.

## The check

  STATIC (no cargo; runs even if nothing in the tree compiles)
    S1  TOTALITY. Every `(crate, feature)` pair enumerated from the Cargo.toml files has a row
        in scripts/feature-tiers.tsv. An UNTIERED pair is RED. This is the whole point: a newly
        added feature cannot arrive silently uncovered, because arriving at all reds the gate.
    S2  STALENESS. Every row names a pair that still exists. A row for a deleted feature is RED,
        not merely ignored. A ledger that can only ever LAG describes a tree that is gone — this
        repository has been bitten by an upward-rotting ledger twice in two days.
    S3  WELL-FORMEDNESS. tier in {T1,T2,T3,T4}; `why` non-empty on every row; a T4 row's `why`
        must OPEN with one of the exemption classes in EXEMPT_CLASSES below, so "exempt because
        reasons" is not spellable. Plus two things the tables below make ENFORCED rather than
        merely documented:
          S3d  a pair whose only enabler is a `workflow_dispatch` workflow (MANUAL_ONLY_EXPLICIT)
               may not be tiered T1 — T1 means green EVERY PUSH, and a near-miss recorded but not
               enforced is how "we know about that" becomes "nothing checks it".
          S3e  every row of scripts/feature-t3-known-red.tsv names a pair that is CURRENTLY T3.
               That file is a SECOND ledger and rots the same way, and the sweep can never catch
               a stale row there because it only judges pairs it actually ran.
    S4  the ledger's own `#!` directives (total + per-tier counts) agree with its rows, so
        trimming rows to make a smaller reality pass requires editing the recorded number too.
    S5  THE FLOORS, hardcoded HERE in reviewed code rather than read from the data the accident
        could take out:
          * MAX_T4          — exemptions cannot grow past the reviewed count without an edit here.
          * MIN_T3          — the compile sweep cannot be emptied into exemptions.
          * MIN_PAIRS       — the enumerator finding almost nothing is an enumerator bug, not a
                              clean tree, and must not read as a pass.
          * NEVER_EXEMPT    — feature NAMES that may never be T4, by name, because their absence
                              is a known wound: prove, prover, private-bazaar-live, no-lean-link,
                              tlsn-live, lean-lib.
          * PUSH_TRIGGERED_EXPLICIT — the `--features` flags CI really passes, with provenance.
                              A T1 row whose only claim is CI must appear here or be activated by
                              default; a stale claim of coverage is RED.

  CARGO (optional; adds failures, never subtracts them)
    C1  --verify-enumeration: the static enumerator (a tomllib reimplementation of cargo's
        implicit-optional-dependency-feature rule) must agree EXACTLY with `cargo metadata
        --no-deps`. This is the guard against the static half quietly drifting from the oracle.
    C2  --verify-t1: every row claiming T1-by-default must be in the default workspace resolve
        that `cargo check --workspace` compiles. Used in the RED direction only: metadata can
        prove a claimed-covered pair is NOT activated, which is sound; it cannot be trusted to
        prove the converse, because resolver-v3 decouples build/proc-macro features and metadata
        reports one union per package. Stated so the inadequacy is visible.

## Why this cannot be defeated by the accident it exists to catch

The expected set is not recorded — it is DERIVED FROM THE TREE, every run, and the ledger must
cover it TOTALLY. That is the opposite arrangement from `check-gates-executed.py`, deliberately:
there the accident DELETES the thing, so the expectation had to be recorded; here the accident
ADDS a thing (a new feature) and the failure is that nothing notices. A recorded list would lag
by exactly the new feature. So the tree is the source and the ledger is the obligation, and the
floors in this file stop the ledger from being emptied into T4.

## --self-test

Runs the whole static checker against synthetic ledgers on every invocation — 19 poles: an
untiered pair, a stale row, a bad tier name, an empty reason, an unclassed exemption, `cost:`
refused as a class, a NEVER_EXEMPT feature parked in T4, an over-ceiling T4, an under-floor T3, a
miscounted directive, a T1 claim with no covering job, a T1-by-default claim in a workspace no
push job builds, an empty enumeration, a stale known-red row, the shard blocks partitioning the
plan for every n, cargo's implicit-optional-dep rule in both polarities, and two intact positive
controls. A guard that cannot be shown to go red is not a guard, and one that reds on everything
is not one either.

EXIT: 0 the ledger totally and non-staleley covers the tree
      1 LEDGER <-> TREE DISAGREEMENT — an untiered pair (a feature arrived uncovered) or a stale
        row (the ledger rotted upward). The incident class.
      2 environment / unparseable ledger ("I could not tell" is not a pass)
      3 the ledger is total, but TIER DISCIPLINE is broken — a floor, an unclassed exemption, or
        a coverage claim that is not true. Deliberately a different code: "the surface is
        unmapped" and "the map lies" are different problems with different fixes.

    # activated all of them. It also made them a hazard — a feature unifies across the resolve,

    # resolved `swgl-standalone` under `-p` and `libservo` under `--workspace`, i.e. a different
    # program depending on which packages cargo had been asked about). `default` is now

    # starbridge-v2-installers.yml, `push: branches: [main]` with NO paths filter, which builds
    # `--release --features desktop` on macos arm64 + x86_64 and on ubuntu.

    # THE PROVENANCE IS TRANSITIVE AND SAYS SO. Only `desktop` is a flag anyone types; the rest

#       because a derivation from the file the accident edits always agrees nothing was expected.
#   T2  heavy but load-bearing — nightly, its own job. These stay OFF by default on purpose
#       (`prove` pulls the plonky3 recursion prover; forcing it into the dev loop would be
#       strictly worse). Armed in .github/workflows/armed-teeth.yml.
#   T3  must at least COMPILE — one `cargo check -p <crate> --features <feature> --all-targets`
#       per pair, run by scripts/feature-t3-sweep.sh from .github/workflows/feature-surface.yml.
#       This catches `#![cfg]` ROT, the majority class: a feature-gated FILE that no longer
#       compiles is invisible until someone turns the feature on, and nobody ever does.
#       `--all-targets` is load-bearing — the gated files here overwhelmingly live in `tests/`.
#       A `why` opening `nodefault:` makes the sweep pass `--no-default-features` (starbridge-v2's
#       `sel4-thin` is mutually exclusive with the default set at the linker level).
#   T4  explicitly EXEMPT, WITH A REASON opening with one of
#       credentials / network / gpu / target / toolchain. COST IS DELIBERATELY NOT A CLASS — an
#       expensive feature is T2, not exempt. armed-teeth.yml's "WHAT IS NOT HERE" section is the
#       discipline being imitated: named, not hidden.
#
# T3 IS COMPILE-ONLY AND SAYS SO. Green means rustc accepted the code. It does not mean the
# feature works, and it NEVER means its tests ran.
#
# COLUMNS (tab-separated; blank lines and '#' comments ignored)
#   crate    cargo package name
#   feature  the feature name as `--features` takes it
#   tier     T1 | T2 | T3 | T4
#   why      T1: `default@<workspace>` or the CI flag. T2: the job that arms it.
#            T3: what turning it on compiles. T4: `<class>: <reason>` — never empty.
