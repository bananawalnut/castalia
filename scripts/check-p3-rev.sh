#!/usr/bin/env bash
# check-p3-rev.sh -- enforce that every hardcoded emberian/plonky3-recursion
# fork rev in the repo matches the single source of truth, scripts/p3-rev.env.
#
# The fork rev resolves the whole workspace's recursion crates and thus the
# compiled verifier. It is pinned in the AUTHORITATIVE workspace deps (root
# Cargo.toml [workspace.dependencies] p3-recursion/p3-circuit/...) and mirrored
# into several CI workflows (sibling-clone REV) and wasm/Cargo.toml's comment.
# All of these MUST stay in lockstep or the built verifier forks silently.
#
# Scoping: root Cargo.toml ALSO pins base upstream Plonky3/Plonky3 at a different
# 40-hex rev, so its p3-recursion rev is isolated by matching only
# `plonky3-recursion` lines (never a blind grep of the whole file). For the CI
# workflows + wasm/Cargo.toml the only 40-hex tokens present are the fork rev.
#
# ALSO enforced (was WARN-only until 2026-07-24): the VK-hash constant
# RECURSION_P3_REV in circuit-prove/src/recursive_witness_bundle.rs. It is the
# proving-system id folded into compute_recursive_vk_hash() -- the value
# lookup_recursive_vk() accepts on, i.e. the light-client trust anchor.
#
# It was excluded as "a VK-epoch event on a human-gated track". That reasoning did
# not survive contact with the code: compute_recursive_vk_hash() is recomputed by
# BOTH producer and verifier from this same constant, and NO golden/frozen hash of
# it exists anywhere in the tree -- so reconciling the string re-keys a value
# nothing external pins. The apex governance anchor DREGG_APEX_RECURSION_VK is a
# blake3 fingerprint of VK MATERIAL (recursion_vk_fingerprint) and does not read
# this constant at all. VK-CEREMONY.md's own cutover lists the reconcile as step
# (3) of §6.1, independent of ceremony output -- it was bundled into a BLOCKED
# ceremony, which is how it stayed drifted while the gate could not fail.
#
# A gate that cannot fail is not a gate (cf. scripts/check-mirror-gates.sh: "a
# gate that cannot bark is worse than none"), and this is the one consumer whose
# drift is directly security-relevant. It FAILS here.
# ── ⚑ `--rev` (added 2026-08-02): grade a COMMIT, not whatever is lying around ──────────
# This gate's verdict is cited in six docs as evidence that the fork rev is in lockstep, and
# without `--rev` every one of those verdicts was taken over a shared working tree: a sibling
# mid-bump has one consumer edited and four not, and the gate reports THEIR intermediate state
# under this gate's name. The mirror is `check-guard-modules.py --rev` / `check-descriptor-
# drift.sh --rev`: materialise the revision with `git archive <rev> | tar -x` and run the whole
# gate against the extract. An archive OF A COMMIT cannot contain churn — that is the same
# guarantee `check-descriptor-drift.sh` buys with an explicit `git status --porcelain` check on
# its worktree, obtained structurally instead.
#
# ── ⚑ ABBREVIATED PINS (2026-08-02): THE AUTHORITATIVE PIN MAY BE SHORTER THAN 40 HEX ────
# This gate FAILED from the day it was written until 2026-08-02, and its message was wrong.
# `d7ba0c4d3` pinned `rev = "fc3c6df"` — seven hex — while this gate matched `[0-9a-f]{40}`
# only. It therefore read NO rev from the authoritative source and reported the pin as
# VANISHED, when in fact the pin was present and the fork had moved TWO commits ahead of
# every mirror (0a4a554e -> fc3c6df, a ConstAir preprocessed-value FLAG DAY). Five mirrors,
# including RECURSION_P3_REV — the recursive VK's proving-system id — advertised a rev that
# was not the one compiling. The abbreviation is now accepted and RESOLVED through
# Cargo.lock's recorded full sha, so a short pin compares correctly and a short-but-DIFFERENT
# pin reds as a MISMATCH. Regression-guarded by arm R9 of scripts/check-p3-rev-selftest.py.
