//! The **multi-cell substance** a native-JS *app* drives — the upgrade from a single
//! [`crate::applet::CellApplet`] to a whole **cap table of cells** one JS program
//! orchestrates.
//!
//! A starbridge-app is not one cell behaving; it is a JS program *coordinating* several
//! cells — set state here, move value there, invoke a service over there. [`CellWorld`]
//! is the engine-independent substance for exactly that: ONE embedded [`DreggEngine`]
//! holding several cells, and a **cap table** recording, per cell the JS holds a cap to,
//! the held authority (the cap tooth's left side) + that cell's affordance surface.
//!
//! Every host capability the JS gets is bounded by this table:
//!
//!   - [`CellWorld::fire_on`] (the `tCell`/`t` host fns) — fire a named cell's affordance
//!     as a REAL cap-gated verified turn. The `is_attenuation` tooth runs in-band against
//!     the held cap for THAT cell; an over-reach commits nothing.
//!   - [`CellWorld::transfer`] (the `transfer` host fn) — move value between two cells the
//!     JS holds caps to, conservation enforced by the executor.
//!   - [`CellWorld::view_patch`] (the `viewPatch` host fn) — a receipted self-edit of the
//!     home cell's committed view-tree blob (moves `heap_root` + leaves a receipt).
//!   - [`CellWorld::get_slot`] (the `get`/`getCell` host fns) — a witnessed read.
//!
//! **The confinement keystone.** The JS references cells only by the *string handles* the
//! host installed in the cap table — there are no ambient cell ids in the sandbox, exactly
//! as there are no ambient host functions. A name absent from the table resolves to
//! [`FireError::NoCapability`]: the cell it would have pointed at is never touched. A name
//! present but whose held cap does not satisfy the affordance's `required` resolves to
//! [`FireError::Unauthorized`]: the same cap tooth `deos-js` already runs. A JS app can
//! therefore touch only the cells it holds caps to, and only at the authority it holds.
