//! # THE DEPLOYED-PATH PROVABILITY LEDGER — every effect must PROVE on the sovereign wide path.
//!
//! "No forges" (soundness) is table stakes. The system is only USABLE if every effect can produce a
//! light-client-verifiable receipt — i.e. PROVE on the deployed sovereign path
//! (`prove_effect_vm_rotated_wide`). This ledger drives each effect through that exact path and
//! asserts it mints a proof that VERIFIES against the executor-anchored wide descriptor. An effect
//! that falls through to the wrong generator (`generate_rotated_transfer_shape_wide`) is UNSAT here —
//! the test REDS until the effect is routed to its real wide generator with real map_heaps.
//!
//! Mirrors `sovereign_rotated_wide.rs` (the transfer/refusal exemplars). Requires `prover`.
//!
//! ## THE FULL-EFFECT MEASURE (the definitive completeness test)
//!
//! `provability_scoreboard_deployed_wide_path` enumerates EVERY non-`NoOp` `VmEffect` variant
//! (`circuit/src/effect_vm/effect.rs`) — the complete effect set the kernel `Effect`
//! (`turn/src/action.rs`) projects onto via the deployed `convert_effects_to_vm` — and drives each
//! HONEST single-effect sovereign turn through the deployed wide producer, asserting the exact
//! PROVABLE / UNPROVABLE-on-wide classification. The per-family prove-through tests below pin the
//! provable effects (proof MINTS + light-client VERIFIES + the AFTER 8-felt commit MOVED off BEFORE
//! = non-vacuity). The UNPROVABLE-on-wide set is NAMED with its real route (cap-write → the cap-open
//! path; custom → the recursion-bound descriptor), never hidden — the honest remaining worklist for
//! "which effect can an agent drive to a light-client receipt on THIS path."

// bounds/declaration check (`descriptor_ir2.rs:1270`); the program-correctness recursion is the
// external engine, threaded onto the wire via `Turn::with_custom_program_proofs` (the
// `custom_program_proofs` field, bound into `Turn::hash`). The 789-wide custom row carries the bound
// proof's `(vk, commit)` in cols 68 / 72 — so the wide receipt + the light-client `verify_proof_bind`
