//! # THE WIDE+UMEM WELD GAUNTLET (STAGED, VK-RISK-FREE) — the genuine flip precursor the VK epoch
//! needs.
//!
//! The sibling [`rotated_umem_weld_staged_gauntlet`] bites the NARROW weld (the umem leg welded onto
//! the 1-felt / 46-PI rotated descriptor — a correct staging artifact, but flipping the deployed
//! WIDE wire onto it would NARROW the ~124-bit commitment to ~46-bit, the no-narrowing scar). THIS
//! gauntlet bites the WIDE weld: a REAL turn proved through ONE descriptor that carries BOTH the
//! whole WIDE rotated cohort proof (the 8-felt / ~124-bit faithful commit, the 16 wide commit PIs at
//! the leg's tail) AND the universal-memory reconciliation leg, via the staged SDK entry
//! [`dregg_sdk::full_turn_proof::prove_wide_umem_welded_staged`].
//!
//! ## What this proves (the WIDE weld, 8-felt preserved)
//!
//! 1. **CONTROL** — the welded WIDE descriptor proves a real transfer-out (rotated semantics + the
//!    universal-memory Balance reconciliation, one proof).
//! 2. **8-FELT PRESERVED (the no-narrowing property)** — the welded leg's published PI vector is
//!    BYTE-IDENTICAL to the wide-only leg's over the SAME transition (the weld appends 0 PIs), so the
//!    LAST 16 PIs — the 8-felt before/after commits `verify_full_turn_bound` binds — are UNCHANGED.
//!    The welded descriptor's `public_input_count` equals the wide descriptor's, and every wide
//!    `PiBinding` survives the weld. The welded leg's 8-felt commits equal the trusted
//!    `wide_commit_anchors` (the SAME ~124-bit anchor the light-client verifier binds).
//! 3. **THE ~124-BIT BINDING TOOTH** — tampering ONE of the welded leg's last-16 PIs (a forged
//!    8-felt commit felt) makes the welded proof FAIL `verify_vm_descriptor2`: the wide carrier
//!    `PiBinding`s ride through the additive weld and bite on the welded form exactly as on the wide
//!    form. So the welded form keeps the full ~124-bit commitment — no narrowing.
//! 4. **THE UMEM ANTI-FORGE TOOTH** — a forged umem op (its claimed committed `prev_val` disagrees
//!    with the genuine pre-state projection) makes the offline universal-memory multiset inconsistent
//!    at the boundary, so the prover REFUSES.
//! 5. **FAIL-CLOSED** — a non-rotated-cohort effect has no welded descriptor and refuses.
//!
//! ## VK-RISK-FREE
//!
//! Pure ADDITIVE: only the STAGED welded WIDE descriptor
//! ([`dregg_circuit::effect_vm_descriptors::weld_umem_into_wide_descriptor`]) + the opt-in welded
//! prover; it touches no deployed descriptor JSON / VK / default prover, and never arms
//! `umem_witness_enabled`. The deployed default stays its current path until the gated VK epoch.
//!
//! Requires `prover`. Self-skips under `not(prover)`.
