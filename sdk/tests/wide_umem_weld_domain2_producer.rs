//! # THE DOMAIN-2 CAP-OPEN UMEM **PRODUCER PLUMBING** LOUD PROBE (STAGED, VK-RISK-FREE) — the umem
//! flip's 12th-catch seam CLOSED.
//!
//! The sibling [`wide_umem_weld_domain2_gauntlet`] bites the welded cap-open PRODUCER in isolation
//! (`prove_cap_open_umem_welded_staged` directly). THIS probe bites the **routing seam** the 12th
//! catch found: the SHARED full-turn path ([`dregg_sdk::prove_full_turn`] →
//! `prove_cohort_run_chain`) — the exact path the deployed node
//! `prove_and_verify_finalized_turn_capability*` drives — now MINTS the WIDE cap-open+umem WELDED leg
//! for a domain-2 cap-gated turn WHEN the caller threads the turn's CAPS-domain universal-memory
//! projection diff via [`dregg_sdk::FullTurnWitness::umem_witness`].
//!
//! ## What this proves (the producer seam)
//!
//! 1. **THE WELDED ROUTE (the seam closed)** — a single-effect `AttenuateCapability` turn with a
//!    consumed-cap membership witness AND a threaded CAPS umem witness mints, through
//!    `prove_full_turn`, an `"effect-vm-rotated"` leg that verifies UNIQUELY through the deployed wire
//!    verifier under the Lean-emitted welded-twin `attenuateCapOpenEffVmDescriptor2R24` member of
//!    [`WIDE_UMEM_WELD_REGISTRY_TSV`]. The leg's vk_hash PINS the WELDED member (PANIC if it does not
//!    — a silent bare-fallback cannot hide).
//! 2. **THE ~124-BIT BINDING TOOTH** — tampering one of the welded leg's last-16 PIs (a forged 8-felt
//!    commit felt) makes the wire verifier REJECT.
//! 3. **THE BARE CONTROL (unaffected)** — the SAME turn with NO umem witness mints the BARE wide
//!    cap-open leg (verifies under the bare wide member, NOT the welded one) — so a cap turn that does
//!    not opt in is byte-for-byte the deployed default.
//!
//! Requires `prover`. Self-skips under `not(prover)`.
