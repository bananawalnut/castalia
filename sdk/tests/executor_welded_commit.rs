//! # THE EXECUTOR WELDED-AWARE COMMIT (STAGED, VK-RISK-FREE) — the umem flip's HARD BLOCKER closed.
//!
//! The deployed executor verify path (`dregg_turn`'s `verify_and_commit_proof_rotated` →
//! `verify_one_cohort_run`) resolves a turn's cohort descriptor BY NAME and verifies the attached
//! `Ir2BatchProof` against it. Before this change it resolved ONLY the bare wide member
//! (`WIDE_REGISTRY_STAGED_TSV`), so a WELDED proof (the wide rotated cohort + the universal-memory
//! reconciliation leg, one descriptor — `prove_wide_umem_welded_staged{,_with_fee}`) would verify
//! under NO resolved descriptor and REJECT — the wire-breaking blocker that gated the umem flip.
//!
//! This test drives a GENUINE welded proof through the DEPLOYED `TurnExecutor::execute` path and
//! asserts it COMMITS: the executor now ALSO resolves the welded twin from
//! `WIDE_UMEM_WELD_REGISTRY_TSV` and accepts a welded proof against it (a UNIQUE-accept beside the
//! bare member). It also asserts the BARE path still commits (the welded twin is PRESENT for a
//! transfer key, yet a bare proof falls back to the bare member and the 8-felt anchors stay bound),
//! and that the welded twin's 8-felt anchors bite (a tampered NEW commitment rejects).
//!
//! ## STAGED / VK-RISK-FREE
//! The executor now ADMITS the welded form on the wire; it does NOT flip the deployed default prover
//! (the cipherclerk still mints bare) nor `umem_witness_enabled`. The weld is PI-COUNT-PRESERVING, so
//! the executor's existing 16-wide-commit-PI (8-felt) reconstruction is byte-identical for the welded
//! form — only the resolved descriptor + verify target change.
//!
//! Requires `prover`; self-skips under `not(prover)`.
