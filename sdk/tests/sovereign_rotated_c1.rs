//! Cutover C1 validation — the ROTATED sovereign proof-carrying matched pair.
//!
//! This integration test drives the cutover's first coherent checkpoint
//! (ROTATION-CUTOVER §EXEC, C1): the sovereign producer
//! ([`AgentCipherclerk::execute_sovereign_turn_with_proof`]) now mints a rotated
//! R=24 `Ir2BatchProof` over the cohort descriptor (instead of the weak hand-AIR
//! `EffectVmAir`), carrying the v9 felt commitment; the matched verifier
//! (`dregg_turn`'s `executor::verify_and_commit_proof`, which graduates to
//! `descriptor_ir2::verify_vm_descriptor2`) reconstructs the 38-PI layout from
//! the after-state it holds and accepts.
//!
//! It lives in `sdk/tests/` (a self-contained compilation unit) rather than the
//! workspace `dregg-tests` harness so the C1 matched pair is validatable
//! independently. Requires the `recursion` feature (the SDK default), which
//! compiles the rotated producer + pulls `dregg-circuit/recursion` (the rotated
//! verifier). Under `not(recursion)` the rotated path does not exist, so the
//! test self-skips.

// ===========================================================================
// THE MULTI-RESIDUE RECORD-PIN ANCHOR — #2 completeness gap: UNREACHABLE (the producer
// fails-closed). The verifier's record-pin anchor (`verify_one_cohort_run`'s PI-38 override)
// projects from the GLOBAL before-cell + the FIRST matching record-pin kernel effect (lead
// only). The concern was that a turn carrying TWO residue-moving record-pin effects on ONE
// cell would force the anchor to diverge from the producer's after-block:
//   * within-run multi-effect: `[SetPermissions(A), SetPermissions(B)]` — ONE cohort run
//     (same descriptor), the producer's after-block reflects BOTH perms (= B), the lead-only
//     anchor would project only the first (= A).
//   * cross-run residue: `[SetPermissions, CellSeal]` — TWO runs, the CellSeal leg's record-pin
//     cell would need the post-SetPermissions residue.
//
// STEP-1 (model-finds-the-bug) shows BOTH turns are UNPRODUCIBLE by the deployed `cipherclerk`
// producer: the WIDE record-pin trace's in-circuit gate (`Ir2Air` constraint #78, row 0) is
// VIOLATED at PROVE time — the panic backtrace lands in `descriptor_ir2::prove_vm_descriptor2`
// ← `prove_effect_vm_rotated_wide` ← `prove_sovereign_turn_rotated`, NEVER reaching the executor
// verifier. The deployed record-pin descriptor binds EXACTLY ONE record-pin row per cohort run;
// a second record-pin row on the same cell (a second SetPermissions, or a lifecycle move stacked
// on a record-digest move) cannot close the proof. The producer therefore CANNOT mint a turn
// that confronts the verifier's lead-only/global-cell anchor with a multi-residue run.
//
// CONCLUSION: the gap is UNREACHABLE — there is NOTHING for the deployed verifier to fix, and a
// fix would be untestable (no positive case can exist) AND would risk the live single-cohort
// fleet. The verifier (`turn/src/executor/proof_verify.rs`) is left UNCHANGED. These tests pin
// the fail-closed boundary so a future producer that lifts the one-record-pin-row limit must
// re-open the verifier anchor question (and add the positive coverage) deliberately.
