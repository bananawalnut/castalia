//! Agent runtime: high-level orchestration of cipherclerk, ledger, and execution.
//!
//! The [`AgentRuntime`] ties together:
//! - An agent cipherclerk (identity + tokens)
//! - A local ledger (cell state)
//! - A turn executor (atomic execution)
//!
//! It provides the highest-level API for agent operations: execute effects,
//! spawn sub-agents with attenuated capabilities, and manage the local cell.
