//! Agent cipherclerk: identity, wallet, signing, and proof generation.
//!
//! The [`AgentCipherclerk`] (legacy alias `AgentCipherclerk`) is the agent's
//! cryptographic clerk — the primary credential holder. It manages:
//! - An Ed25519 signing identity
//! - A collection of held authorization tokens (macaroon-backed)
//! - Token attenuation and delegation to other agents
//! - Turn signing for submission to the ledger
//! - Zero-knowledge proof generation via the bridge layer
//!
//! The name traces to Greg Egan's *Polis* and its descendants, where a
//! citizen's cipherclerk is the autonomous component that holds keys,
//! attests credentials, and brokers capabilities on the citizen's
//! behalf. "Wallet" was a poor fit: dregg wallets mostly manage
//! *capabilities*, not balances.

    // Delegation Envelope Signing / Verification (v2)
    //
    // Authority model:
    //   The delegation envelope is signed by the delegator's cipherclerk key. The
    //   receiver supplies a `DelegationAuthority` policy that decides which
    //   delegator key is authorized (TrustedKey / TrustedKeys / ChainsFromParent
    //   / Open). The signature MUST verify under the asserted delegator key, AND
    //   the asserted delegator key MUST be accepted by the policy.
    //
    //   We do not chain to a root issuer because dregg cipherclerks are sovereign:
    //   there is no global registry of "who is allowed to mint a token". Trust
    //   is established explicitly by the receiver — either by hard-coding an
    //   expected key, or by linking to a previously-accepted parent envelope.
    //
    // Signed payload:
    //   The v2 payload binds every authority-affecting field:
    //     - token_bytes (the actual macaroon being delegated)
    //     - delegatee (who can present this token)
    //     - service (which service this token is for)
    //     - id (token identifier)
    //     - restrictions (the attenuations applied)
    //     - proof_key (the BLAKE3-derived ZK proof key, if any)
    //     - caveat_chain_hash (caveat integrity commitment)
    //     - membership_leaf (federation-proof leaf, if any)
    //     - parent_delegation_hash (links chains; zero for root delegations)
    //     - delegator_public_key (binds the signer to the envelope)
    //
    //   Domain separation uses `blake3::keyed_hash` with the v2 envelope context,
    //   distinct from the v1 binding tag and from the local-delegation tag.
