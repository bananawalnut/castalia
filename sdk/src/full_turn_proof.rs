//! Full turn proof composition: a single composed STARK covering ALL validity aspects.
//!
//! A remote verifier (bridge, light client, peer) receiving a [`FullTurnProof`] can
//! verify in one shot:
//! - The state transition is correct (Effect VM)
//! - The actor was authorized (Derivation chain)
//! - The capability existed (C-list membership)
//! - Value was conserved (Conservation)
//! - Nothing was revoked (Non-revocation)
//!
//! The proof IS the truth. No trust in any executor required.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! ```text
//! FullTurnProof
//! +-- ComposedProof (single STARK)
//! |   +-- main_proof: StarkProof
//! |   +-- sub_proofs:
//! |       [0] Effect VM proof (state transition)
//! |       [1] Authorization proof (derivation chain)
//! |       [2] Membership proof (c-list)
//! |       [3] Conservation proof (value balance) — optional
//! |       [4] Non-revocation proof (freshness) — optional
//! +-- public_inputs: [old_commit, new_commit, turn_hash, ...]
//! +-- components: TurnProofComponents (which sub-proofs included)
//! ```
//!
//! # Public Input Layout (merged from sub-proofs)
//!
//! The composed proof's public inputs are the concatenation of all sub-proof PIs,
//! laid out by `compose_aggregate`. A verifier checks:
//! 1. Effect VM PIs: old_commitment, new_commitment, net_delta, effects_hash
//! 2. Authorization PIs: state_root, derived_hash (must bind to capability used)
//! 3. Membership PIs: leaf_hash, merkle_root (must match authorization's state_root)
//! 4. Conservation PIs: (if present) commitment sums balance
//! 5. Non-revocation PIs: revocation_root (from federation state)
//!
//! Cross-proof PI bindings:
//! - Authorization state_root == Membership merkle_root (same fact tree)
//! - Effect VM old_commitment is the cell state the actor is authorized to mutate
//! - Authorization derived_hash == Allow(effects_hash): the authorization
//!   conclusion is bound to THIS turn's effects (effect-kind + cell + params),
//!   not merely to "some fact in this cell's tree" (see [`effect_action_binding`])
//! - Non-revocation root matches the federation's published revocation accumulator
