//! # Hatchery abstraction-mint — minting an OPEN vocabulary of verified cell-kinds.
//!
//! The kernel ships a *fixed* vocabulary of cell shapes: a cell is whatever its
//! installed [`CellProgram`] says it is, and the executor re-evaluates that
//! program on every state-modifying turn. The [factory][dregg_cell::factory]
//! layer lets one author a **content-addressed constructor** that bakes a
//! perpetual `state_constraints` set onto every child it produces. The
//! [Hatchery](../../../HATCHERY.md) supplies the other half: a *prove-once,
//! hold-forever* toolkit (`Dregg2.Verify.Contract.CellContract`) whose single
//! obligation `step_ob : ∀ s c, Inv s → Inv (E.next s c)` — a single-step
//! preservation, the **hpres** — is fed to `livingCellA_carries` and hands back
//! `∀ n, Inv (trajA s sched n)`: the invariant holds at every step of the
//! unbounded trajectory, against every adversarial schedule.
//!
//! This module is the **weld**. A [`MintedKind`] is exactly:
//!
//! 1. a [`FactoryDescriptor`] whose `state_constraints` ARE the kind's invariant
//!    (so every minted cell carries the invariant as its program-for-life, and
//!    the executor enforces it forever — that is the kernel doing the holding);
//! 2. an [`Invariant`] — the structured shape the author declared (e.g.
//!    "balance never negative", "this field is monotone"); and
//! 3. an [`HpresProof`] slot — the attestation that the invariant actually
//!    *holds* under a single living-cell step (the Hatchery's `step_ob`).
//!
//! The path it opens: from a fixed vocabulary of kernel shapes to an **OPEN
//! vocabulary of verified kinds**. A user defines a new cell-KIND with its own
//! invariant, attests the invariant once, and the kernel enforces it as
//! first-class — every cell of that kind, every turn, forever.
//!
//! ## What "enforced as first-class" means here (no stub)
//!
//! Enforcement is **not** added by this module. It is the executor's existing
//! evaluation of the child's `CellProgram` (the same gate every settlement /
//! storage / governance cell faces): [`MintedKind::evaluate_transition`]
//! delegates straight to [`CellProgram::evaluate_with_meta`]. A turn that
//! violates the invariant returns `Err(ProgramError::ConstraintViolated{..})` —
//! a real refusal, reproduced bit-for-bit by any re-executing validator. A
//! conforming turn returns `Ok(())`.
//!
//! ## The forge-detector
//!
//! Minting alone does not make a cell honest: a cell could *claim* to be of a
//! minted kind while installing a program that omits the invariant. The kind is
//! content-addressed — [`MintedKind::kind_id`] — and the invariant is baked into
//! the descriptor's hash, so [`MintedKind::attest_membership`] is the gate that
//! rejects **membership-without-conformance**: a cell whose installed program
//! does not carry the kind's invariant constraints is rejected
//! ([`ForgeRejection::ProgramMissingInvariant`]), even if it waves the kind id
//! around. Conformance is membership.
//!
//! ## The Lean rung — the invariant is PROVEN, not just smoke-tested
//!
//! The abstraction-mint invariant is grounded in `metatheory/Dregg2/Deos/
//! Hatchery.lean` (the LAST of the six house capacities — the house COMPLETE):
//! the per-turn gate IS the declared invariant (`evalStep_admits_iff_*`), an
//! admitted step preserves it (`step_preserves`, the **hpres**), and the SAME
//! `Verify.Contract.CellContract` carry skeleton lifts it to the unbounded
//! trajectory — `invariant_forever`: under EVERY schedule of admitted turns, a
//! minted cell carries its invariant for life. The Lean binds
//! [`HpresProof::Attested`] to a machine-checked `CellContract`: its `Attested`
//! structure cannot be constructed without a real contract (hence a real
//! `step_ob` proof term), so an attestation is a *proved* forever-crown
//! (`attested_enforces_forever`), not a trusted flag — and an attestation for a
//! *different* invariant is rejected by the decidable content-hash check
//! (`forged_attestation_rejected`). The forge-detector here is the executor
//! image of that rung; [`tests::invariant_matches_lean_rung`] mirrors the Lean
//! witnesses so the Rust rejection is tied to the proven statement.
//!
//! The DEEPER weld — binding the kind's invariant into the EffectVM circuit so a
//! light client (not just a re-executing validator) witnesses it as part of the
//! proven kernel transition — is VK-affecting and is the named per-capacity
//! follow-up (`metatheory/docs/HOUSE-CAPACITIES-WELD-PLAN.md`, hatchery row), the
//! same lane the cap-root reshape drives.
