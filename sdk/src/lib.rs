//! # dregg-sdk
//!
//! # Which semantics does a deployed SDK run?
//!
//! The SDK builds and signs turns; the **federation node executes them**. Today
//! that execution runs on the LEGACY dregg1 Rust executor (`dregg-turn`), with
//! the VERIFIED Lean executor (`metatheory/Dregg2/`, via `dregg-lean-ffi`)
//! running as a SHADOW that compares its commit decision against the Rust path
//! (gated on `DREGG_LEAN_SHADOW=1`). The source of truth for the semantics is
//! the Lean — the Rust executor is the subject-under-test pending THE SWAP
//! (cutover to `dregg_exec_full_forest_auth` as the authoritative executor).
//!
//! Concretely, when you deploy this SDK today: turn-building, key management,
//! attenuation and proof generation are SDK-local Rust; the on-chain *effect
//! semantics* applied to those turns are the legacy Rust executor's, validated
//! turn-by-turn against the verified Lean (for every effect the shadow projector
//! covers — see `turn/src/lean_shadow.rs` and
//! `metatheory/docs/rebuild/_DREGG1-DREGG2-UNIFICATION-LEDGER.md`). After the
//! swap, the verified Lean semantics ARE what runs. Track the cutover in
//! `metatheory/docs/rebuild/SUCCESSOR-ROADMAP.md`.
//!
//! # Trust Model
//!
//! This crate operates at the **CLIENT-LOCAL** trust level.
//!
//! - **Soundness**: The SDK runs entirely on the user's device. It manages private keys,
//!   token chains, and proof generation locally. The user trusts their own device and
//!   the SDK's correct implementation. No other party can observe or interfere with
//!   SDK operations (assuming a secure device).
//! - **Assumptions**: The user's device is not compromised. Private keys remain in local
//!   memory/storage. The SDK correctly implements proof generation, token attenuation,
//!   and turn signing. Network interactions are authenticated (TLS to silos).
//! - **Verifiable by**: Only the user. The SDK's outputs (signed turns, proofs,
//!   presentations) are verified by the federation, but the SDK's internal state
//!   (held tokens, cipherclerk contents) is private to the user.
//!
//! ## Security Properties
//! - Key material never leaves the device (unless explicitly exported)
//! - Proof generation is local (witness data stays on-device)
//! - Token attenuation preserves the narrowing invariant (cannot escalate)
//! - Selective disclosure reveals only chosen facts
//!
//! ## What the SDK Does NOT Trust
//! - Remote silos (verified via TLS + receipt chains)
//! - Federation state (verified via attested roots + STARK proofs)
//! - Other agents (interactions mediated by capabilities)
//!
//! The unified agent SDK for the dregg federation protocol.
//!
//! This crate provides a single ergonomic entry point for agents that need to:
//! - Hold and manage authorization tokens (macaroon-backed)
//! - Attenuate and delegate tokens to sub-agents
//! - Sign and submit execution turns
//! - Generate zero-knowledge presentation proofs
//! - Interact with remote silos over the wire protocol
//!

//!
//! # The cipherclerk
//!
//! `AgentCipherclerk` (alias `AgentCClerk`, legacy alias `AgentCipherclerk`) is the
//! agent-side *cryptographic clerk*: it holds signing keys, authorization
//! tokens, the receipt chain, and presents credentials/proofs on behalf of a
//! Principal. The name borrows from Greg Egan's *Polis* (and its descendants),
//! where a citizen's "cipherclerk" is the autonomous component that manages
//! their cryptographic identity and capability handles. "Cipherclerk" was a poor
//! fit — cipherclerks connote value storage, but a dregg cipherclerk's authority
//! is mostly *capabilities*, not balances.
//!
//! # Quick Start
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use dregg_sdk::{AgentCipherclerk, AgentRuntime};
//! use dregg_token::Attenuation;
//!
//! // Create a cipherclerk with a fresh identity
//! let mut cclerk = AgentCipherclerk::new();
//!
//! // Mint a root token for our service
//! let root_token = cclerk.mint_token(b"my-secret-root-key-32-bytes!!!!!", "my-service");
//!
//! // Attenuate it for a specific task
//! let restricted = cclerk.attenuate(&root_token, &Attenuation {
//!     services: vec![("dns".into(), "r".into())],
//!     ..Default::default()
//! }).unwrap();
//! ```

// This crate is the OFFLINE CORE of the SDK: no tokio / reqwest / dregg-wire /
