//! The EROS image-builder: build-time IMAGE GENESIS.
//!
//! "Here's my OS + a proof of what it can't do."
//!
//! This is the build-time half of the genesis reframe (the runtime half is
//! turns). It takes a declarative [`ImageManifest`] — a set of EROS object
//! factories ([`FactoryDescriptor`]s) plus the cells to create from them — and
//! assembles a verified initial cell-graph into a SEALED, ATTESTABLE image:
//! a [`Snapshot`] (the sealed-state carrier, with its root-binding fail-closed
//! tooth) wrapped in an [`ImageArtifact`] that carries an [`ImageAttestation`].
//!
//! # What the attestation attests (and what it does NOT)
//!
//! The attestation is HONEST about its reach. It attests, and a recipient can
//! verify WITHOUT trusting the builder:
//!
//! - **Factory provenance.** Every cell was built from one of a fixed set of
//!   content-addressed [`FactoryDescriptor`]s (BLAKE3 `descriptor_hash`). The
//!   descriptor IS the constructor transparency: it pins the child program-VK
//!   strategy, the cap templates, the field constraints, and the **perpetual
//!   `state_constraints` baked onto every child cell's `CellProgram` for life**.
//!   The attestation records the sorted set of factory hashes; the verifier
//!   recomputes them. "This OS was built from these verified constructors."
//!
//! - **Conservation.** `BALANCE_SUM == 0` across the image (issuer wells carry
//!   −supply). The verifier recomputes the sum from the reconstructed ledger.
//!   "This OS conserves value."
//!
//! - **Root binding.** The `claimed_root` is the canonical `Ledger::root()` of
//!   the reconstructed cell-graph (`Snapshot`'s anti-substitution tooth). The
//!   verifier rebuilds `checkpoint ⊕ overlay` and refuses any mismatch.
//!   "This OS has exactly this state."
//!
//! - **Program-for-life binding.** Each created cell carries
//!   `CellProgram::Predicate(factory.state_constraints)` — the lifetime
//!   invariants its factory bakes in. The verifier re-derives each cell's
//!   program from its claimed factory and refuses a cell whose program does not
//!   match its factory's declared constraints. THIS is "what it can't do",
//!   made checkable: the recipient reads the factory descriptors to see what
//!   caps/programs the cells can EVER exercise.
//!
//! It does NOT yet attest (named seams, not silent gaps):
//!
//! - **The full Hatchery single-step invariant proofs (`hpres`).** The image
//!   carries the factory descriptors (the *declared* invariants) but not yet
//!   the `livingCellA_carries` proof object that an invariant HOLDS for one
//!   step → holds forever. The seam is marked at [`ImageAttestation`]:
//!   `hatchery_invariant_proof` is the slot where the `hpres` proof attaches.
//!
//! - **A cryptographic seal/signature.** The artifact is content-addressed and
//!   self-verifying (re-derive everything, fail-closed) but is not yet SIGNED
//!   by a builder key. The `seal` slot is reserved for that.
//!
//! - **The seL4 boot-wire.** Generating the `deos-image` `image_data.rs` const
//!   from a manifest via this builder (replacing the hand-built 6-cell const in
//!   `cell/examples/gen_image_snapshot.rs`) is a follow-up: the viewer PD is
//!   `#![no_std]` and cannot link this crate, so the wire is a codegen step,
//!   not a link. See [`crate::image_builder::tests`] for a manifest that
//!   reproduces the conservation shape that const ships.
