//! Durable, crash-consistent commit log + secondary index.
//!
//! # What problem this solves
//!
//! Before this module, the node's recovery anchor (`executed_up_to`) and the
//! finalized ledger state were persisted by *independent* transactions at
//! *different* cadences: `executed_up_to` advanced every batch
//! (`blocklace_sync::persist_blocklace_state`), while the ledger was
//! checkpointed only every `LEDGER_CHECKPOINT_INTERVAL` blocks
//! (`blocklace_sync::maybe_checkpoint_ledger`). A crash between those two writes
//! left the durable `executed_up_to` ahead of the durable ledger, and recovery
//! performed **no replay** for the gap — so every finalized turn between the
//! last ledger checkpoint and `executed_up_to` was silently lost from the
//! restored ledger (torn state). Receipts were never persisted at all
//! (the cipherclerk chain lived only in RAM).
//!
//! # The commit log
//!
//! The commit log is the authoritative, append-only record of the turns THIS
//! node has applied, in the node's tau-finalized order. Each [`CommitRecord`]
//! is written in the **same redb transaction** that:
//!   * advances the durable commit cursor ([`tables::META_COMMIT_CURSOR`]),
//!   * inserts the per-turn index entries (receipt-by-hash, turn-by-hash,
//!     turn-by-(height, creator)), and
//!   * upserts the per-turn cell snapshots into the cell-by-id index.
//!
//! redb is an ACID store: a transaction either fully commits (durably, with an
//! fsync at the commit boundary) or does not appear at all. Because all of the
//! above land in one transaction, the following invariants hold across an
//! arbitrary crash (even one that kills the process mid-write):
//!
//!   * **No torn state.** The cursor and the record at `cursor-1` are always
//!     consistent: every ordinal in `[compacted_floor, cursor)` resolves to a
//!     record, and `commit_cursor() == commit_log.len() + compacted_floor`
//!     (the `compacted_floor == 0` special case is the pre-compaction
//!     `cursor == len`; see [`Self::compact_below`]).
//!   * **No lost finalized turn.** A turn the node *durably* committed is
//!     recoverable with its full coordinates and the post-state of every cell it
//!     touched — either from its log record, OR (once [`Self::compact_below`]
//!     has removed that record under a covering checkpoint) from the checkpoint
//!     that subsumes it. Compaction never removes a record a checkpoint does not
//!     subsume, so the finalized state is never lost.
//!   * **No double-apply.** Recovery resumes from `commit_cursor()`, which is
//!     advanced once per applied turn inside the commit transaction; a turn whose
//!     transaction did not commit is simply re-applied (idempotently) on the
//!     next poll, and one whose transaction *did* commit is never re-applied.
//!     This holds across compaction: a compacted turn's `block_id` is retained
//!     (`COMMIT_COMPACTED_BLOCK_IDS`) and still reported by
//!     [`Self::commit_log_block_ids`], so the identity execution cursor still
//!     sees it as applied and never re-executes it on top of the checkpoint.
//!   * **Index agrees with the log.** Every index entry exists *iff* the commit
//!     log has the corresponding record. [`PersistentStore::verify_index_agrees_with_log`]
//!     checks this; [`PersistentStore::rebuild_index_from_log`] re-derives the
//!     entire index from the log alone.
//!
//! The commit cursor is the crash-consistent replacement for the prior
//! separately-written `executed_up_to`; recovery reads it via
//! [`PersistentStore::commit_cursor`].
//!
//! # Layering
//!
//! This module stays independent of `dregg-turn`: the node hashes the turn /
//! receipt coordinates and passes them in as plain bytes, alongside the
//! `(CellId, Cell)` snapshots of every cell the turn touched. `dregg-cell` is
//! already a dependency, so cell snapshots are serialized here.

    /// ([`Self::recovered_ledger_root`]). A torn or poisoned write — a process
    /// killed between the input-turn config write and the commit-record txn, a

    /// tearing the same file — leaves the log's tail inconsistent with that
    /// recorded root, and the check refuses the whole image. That STRANDS the
    /// owner: a divergent tail makes the entire durable session unopenable.
    ///
    /// Recovery is the right answer, not refusal. Each [`CommitRecord`] carries
    /// its OWN post-state root (`ledger_root`), so the log is self-checking at
    /// every ordinal: reconstructing `checkpoint ⊕ overlay[..=k]` and comparing to
    /// `record[k].ledger_root` decides whether the prefix through `k` is internally
    /// consistent. This walks the live log in ordinal order, tracks the last `k`
    /// that converges, and TRUNCATES `(k, cursor)` — dropping the divergent tail —
    /// so the image opens at the last-good state and the convergence check then
    /// PASSES at the recovered point. The recovery model is unchanged for the
    /// surviving prefix (`CrashRecovery.recover_eq_replay`): we only discard turns
    /// whose durable post-state cannot be reproduced, which were never safely
    /// committed in the first place.

    /// The per-prefix root MUST be computed with the SAME commitment the records
