//! # `dregg-lightclient` — the whole-history light client.
//!
//! ## What this is (the magnesium → gold endpoint, Rust side)
//!
//! A light client that trusts the WHOLE finalized history of N turns by verifying ONE succinct
//! recursive aggregate — the [`WholeChainProof`] that `circuit/src/ivc_turn_chain.rs::
//! prove_turn_chain_recursive` folds — and **re-witnessing nothing**: no re-execution of any turn,
//! no re-hashing of any state, no walk of the blocklace. It calls the single succinct verifier
//! [`verify_turn_chain_recursive`] (whose cost is independent of N) and, on success, reads off the
//! public commitments the aggregate binds.
//!
//! This is the executable counterpart of the Lean theorem
//! `Dregg2.Circuit.RecursiveAggregation.light_client_verifies_whole_history`. Under `EngineSound` —
//! the plonky3 FRI obligation `recursive_sound`, the EffectVm circuit⟺executor obligation
//! `leaf_sound`, the `TurnChainBindingAir` obligation `binding_sound` — verifying `agg.root` yields
//! `AggregateAttests`. What the fold discharges in-circuit:
//!
//! - `binding_sound` — ordering (no reorder/drop/insert, the temporal tooth `new_root[i] ==
//!   old_root[i+1]`) and the final root as the genuine fold, via the wrapped `TurnChainBindingAir`
//!   leaf;
//! - `leaf_sound` — **the folded leaves ARE the turn circuits**: each leaf is the Lean-descriptor
//!   EffectVM AIR (`EffectVmDescriptorAir`, the graduated ONE-circuit cutover constraint set —
//!   Poseidon2 state-commit hash sites, transition continuity, `OLD/NEW_COMMIT` PI bindings, range
//!   checks) re-proven over that turn's REAL 186-column execution trace and verified IN-CIRCUIT by
//!   the recursion wrap (`circuit/src/ivc_turn_chain.rs::prove_descriptor_leaf` +
//!   `build_and_prove_next_layer`). The host-side descriptor admission
//!   (`verify_descriptor_participant`) is an admission discipline, NOT the soundness boundary: a
//!   prover that SKIPS it cannot produce a verifying root for a forged turn, because a forged
//!   `(old_root, new_root)` has no satisfying leaf (the `ungated_prover_with_forged_post_commit_
//!   cannot_produce_a_root` / `ungated_prover_with_stub_leaf_cannot_produce_a_root` tamper tests in
//!   `ivc_turn_chain`).
//!
//! The light client additionally holds a **trust anchor**: the [`RecursionVk`] verifier-key
//! fingerprint of the honest root circuit, obtained once from an honest setup fold and distributed
//! exactly like any SNARK VK (genesis/checkpoint configuration — NEVER taken from the artifact under
//! verification). [`verify_history`] refuses unless (1) the presented root's recomputed fingerprint
//! equals the anchor (a from-scratch prover aggregating a DIFFERENT circuit's proofs is refused
//! here — previously the engine reconstructed circuit data from the proof itself and accepted any
//! valid recursive proof), (2) the carried `genesis_root`/`final_root`/`num_turns`/`chain_digest`
//! verify as the public inputs of the carried chain-binding STARK (Fiat–Shamir binds all four, so a
//! relabeled public claim is refused — the publics are read against a proof, not trusted as bare
//! fields), and (3) the root batch proof verifies.
//!
//! What remains NAMED, not discharged (the honest floor): `recursive_sound` — the recursion fork's
//! FRI/STARK engine soundness. This is the SAME standard assumption every recursive STARK chain
//! carries (Mina/Plonky3-style: FRI soundness, like collision-resistance for a hash) — it is NOT a
//! dregg-specific gap and is not provable in Lean. The two precisely-scoped fork follow-ups that
//! once sat ALONGSIDE it are now DISCHARGED (in-band, in `circuit-prove/src/ivc_turn_chain.rs`'s
//! `aggregate_tree`), so recursion soundness rests on `recursive_sound` ALONE:
//!
//! - (a) **leaf-circuit identity pinned in-band — CLOSED.** Every child of the K-fold tree (each
//!   descriptor leaf and each interior aggregation node) is folded through the fork's
//!   `into_recursion_input_pinned`: the child's own preprocessed commitment (its VK-identity core,
//!   the Merkle cap binding its static op-list) is baked as a CONSTANT the parent aggregation
//!   circuit `connect`s its child-commitment targets to. A foreign-circuit child is refused either
//!   way — keep the honest constant and the foreign child's in-circuit preprocessed-trace FRI check
//!   is UNSAT; bake the foreign commitment and the ROOT VK fingerprint (tooth 1) stops matching the
//!   honest anchor. The pinned constants live in every node's op-list up to the root, so the root VK
//!   pin TRANSITIVELY certifies the whole tree's leaf identity (no same-shape argument left).
//! - (b) **leaf public values re-exposed at the root — CLOSED.** Each child is fed with its GENUINE
//!   per-table public inputs threaded up (`into_recursion_input_pinned` calls
//!   `genuine_table_public_inputs`, not the empty-vector legacy path), so a child's exposed segment
//!   publics are re-verified IN-CIRCUIT at the next layer. Combined with the ordered SEGMENT
//!   accumulator, the whole-chain `[genesis_root, final_root, num_turns, chain_digest]` is
//!   re-exposed at the root (`expose_claim`) and host-checked (verify tooth 3) — the carried claim
//!   is in-band linked to the REAL descriptor leaves folded INSIDE the root.
//!
//! [`AttestedHistory`] is the `AggregateAttests` verdict under that one named crypto carrier, and
//! [`verify_history`] is the light-client check.
//!
//! ## Retrieving the bytes behind a verified commitment (data availability)
//!
//! Verifying a commitment is not the same as being able to RETRIEVE the bytes
//! behind it. A wallet/bridge that holds an [`AttestedHistory`] still needs the
//! actual data (a receipt, a cell blob, a document) — and must not have to trust
//! a single server to hand it over (a server can withhold). The DA retrieval
//! side lives in `dregg_storage::retrieval` (kept there because it is light —
//! no circuit/prover deps — and the heavy lightclient↔storage edge would close a
//! workspace dependency cycle): a client holds a small
//! `dregg_storage::availability::AvailabilityManifest` (binding the blob's
//! content hash, erasure-set Merkle root, and `k`-of-`n` thresholds), then calls
//! `dregg_storage::retrieval::retrieve` / `retrieve_via_http` to fetch `k`-of-`n`
//! chunks from several (untrusted, possibly withholding) nodes, Merkle-verify
//! each against the manifest root, and reconstruct the content-hash-bound blob.
//! A node's `GET /storage/{manifest,chunk}` routes (`dregg-node`'s storage
//! gateway) serve those records; withholding up to `n_total - n_data` chunks is
//! survived (k-of-n) and a forged chunk is rejected by its Merkle path.
//! `dregg_storage::retrieval::sample_das` is the live data-availability sampler
//! (sample random chunks from peers → confidence the blob is available, without
//! downloading it whole).
//!
//! ## Proofs are ADDITIVE ATTESTATION — and that is the POINT.
//!
//! The light client does NOT re-derive history. The succinct proof's validity IS the trust. A node
//! that produced the history runs the (expensive) prover once; every downstream verifier — a wallet,
//! a bridge, a peer syncing from a checkpoint — runs `verify_history` and obtains the same whole-
//! history attestation in constant work. That is the whole value of the IVC fold.
//!
//! ## The honest trust boundary (mirrors the Lean named hypotheses)
//!
//! `verify_turn_chain_recursive` is the plonky3 recursive-STARK verifier; its soundness is the FRI
//! obligation the Lean model NAMES (`EngineSound.recursive_sound`) rather than re-proves — you cannot
//! prove plonky3 FRI soundness in Lean, and this crate does not pretend to. What the light client
//! DOES guarantee, gap-free, is the COMPOSITION: IF the aggregate verifies (engine sound), THEN the
//! whole history is attested — which is precisely where a real aggregation bug (verify proof-of-step-7
//! but export step-3's roots; swap a leg; drop a turn) would have to surface, and the Lean
//! `light_client_verifies_whole_history` + `tampered_aggregate_cannot_bind` + `leaf_pairing_defeats_
//! swap` show it cannot.
//!
//! Build: `cargo build -p dregg-lightclient` (carries `dregg-circuit` with its default `recursion`
//! feature). Tests fold a real K-turn chain and light-verify it, and confirm a corrupted aggregate is
//! rejected.
