//! # `whole_history_demo` — the aggregate-then-light-verify demo (real output).
//!
//! This is the working demonstration the GOLD-tier history-compression story claims: take a chain of
//! several REAL finalized turns (each a genuine Lean-descriptor EffectVM proof with Poseidon2 state
//! commitments, whose full constraint set is re-proven and verified IN-CIRCUIT as the fold's leaf),
//! fold them — via the existing prover, read-only — into ONE constant-size aggregate
//! (`WholeChainProof`), and then have the light client verify the WHOLE history from just that
//! aggregate, re-witnessing NOTHING: no re-execution of any turn, no re-hashing of any state, no walk
//! of the blocklace.
//!
//! It is the executable embodiment of the Lean theorem
//! `Dregg2.Circuit.RecursiveAggregation.light_client_verifies_whole_history` — and the three-leg
//! `FinalizedLightClient.light_client_accepts_finalized_history`.
//!
//! Run: `cargo run -p dregg-lightclient --bin whole_history_demo`.
