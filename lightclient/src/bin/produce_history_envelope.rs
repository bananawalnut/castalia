//! `produce_history_envelope` — emit a REAL `ExternalHistoryEnvelope` JSON.
//!
//! The PRODUCER side of the whole-history light client, run NATIVELY (the expensive
//! recursive fold belongs off the verifier — a node/relayer runs it once). It folds
//! a real `k`-turn chain into ONE `WholeChainProof` and prints the versioned wire
//! envelope (the SAME shape the wasm `produce_external_history_envelope` emits, and
//! the SAME shape the wasm `verify_devnet_history` consumes), plus the config VK
//! anchor a verifier holds SEPARATELY.
//!
//! The browser light-client page bakes this output and verifies it in-tab
//! (`verify_devnet_history`) — re-witnessing nothing. The heavy fold is here; the
//! cheap verify is in the tab.
//!
//! Run: `cargo run -p dregg-lightclient --bin produce_history_envelope --features prover -- [k] [step]`
//!
//! To refresh the checked-in real-proof fixtures from the same aggregate, pass
//! `--fixture-root <repository-root>`. This writes the raw proof, its independently held anchor,
//! and both browser JSON copies only after the fold has proved and light-verified successfully.
