//! # dregg-braid-hook — the reusable Braid wiring, game-content-free
//!
//! This crate GRADUATES the Braid ([`dregg_entity_compose`] over [`dregg_param_compose`]) from a
//! disconnected island into the wired substrate. It is the in-tree consumer a game or offering
//! calls to compose a **param-carrying entity** through the Custom-VK Door and land the result as
//! a verifiable turn whose published **outcome** is welded — in-circuit, light-client-visible — to
//! the committed cell field.
//!
//! Everything speaks `subject`/`params`/`role`/`ruleset`/`outcome`; nothing here is a creature, a
//! stat, or a game rule. A HOARDLIGHT world is ONE ruleset root + content over this hook.
//!
//! **First rider — a real game, not a test:** `dreggnet-companion`'s `wing` module. Two raised
//! companions attune into a wing whose worth composes `level × level` and `rarity × rarity` off
//! their live committed leveling cells, and seals through `fold::fold_composition_app_root`. The
//! game supplies the roles, the param schema, the coefficients and the meaning; this crate supplies
//! only the wiring, and nothing about that rider appears here.
//!
//! ## What the hook does
//!
//! * [`compose_entity`] (always available) deploys a sovereign entity whose wide plane carries a
//!   typed param vector and composes those params (plus partners) into a licensed `outcome` under
//!   a versioned ruleset — [`compose_onto`] through the Door. The returned [`LandedComposition`]
//!   already carries the **app-root binding** ([`LandedComposition::app_root_binding`]): the
//!   declaration that the sub-proof's published `outcome_commitment` PI must equal the entity
//!   cell's committed native `fields[0..8]` octet.
//!
//! * [`fold`] (feature `prove`) turns that landed composition into a fold-ready custom turn:
//!   [`fold::braid_direct_ir2_bundle`] packages the re-provable composition leaf + the app-root
//!   binding into a `CustomIr2WitnessBundle`, and [`fold::mint_entity_custom_leg`] mints the wide
//!   Custom leg over the entity's real cell. Handed to the deployed chain prover (or folded
//!   directly through `prove_direct_ir2_binding_node_app_root_segmented`), a turn whose published
//!   outcome does not match the committed octet has NO satisfying fold — UNSAT, refused.
//!
//! ## The substrate, said out loud
//!
//! Two different things, both worth naming:
//!
//! * **The composition AIR is LEAN-AUTHORED** (`ParamComposeEmit.lean`). The sub-proof leaf
//!   re-proves that EMITTED descriptor directly (`prove_direct_ir2_leaf_with_app_root_commitment`)
//!   rather than lowering a Rust `CellProgram`, so the relation has exactly one semantics. Rust
//!   fills the trace; it authors no constraint.
//! * **The outcome→cell-field weld is not hand-written Rust AIR and not new Lean AIR.** It is an
//!   ADOPTION of the deployed app-root atom (the same in-circuit tie the multiway-tug win-proof
//!   ships): a `connect` inside the recursion tree a pure light client folds, whose keystone
//!   descends from Lean `CustomBindingFromFold`. This crate only DECLARES the binding and routes
//!   the fold through the deployed node.
