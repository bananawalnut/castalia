//! # Phase 3 — the STARK FOLD: the hidden-hand tooth lowered into the recursive fold.
//!
//! Phase 2 ([`crate::hidden_hand`]) committed each hand as a Poseidon2 4-ary Merkle root
//! and proved each play with a `StateConstraint::Witnessed { MerkleMembership }` tooth,
//! checked IN THE CLEAR by the real cell evaluator + registry. Phase 3 lowers that tooth
//! INTO THE FOLD: a whole PRIVATE match — a sequence of membership-proven plays — becomes
//! ONE succinct proof a pure light client ([`dregg_lightclient::verify_history`]) accepts,
//! re-witnessing nothing.
//!
//! ## How the hidden-hand tooth reaches the fold
//!
//! The lowering lives in the IMT terminal ([`game_turn_slice::compiler`]): a
//! [`PlayProof`](crate::hidden_hand::PlayProof)'s leaf opening + authentication path + root
//! become a [`LoweredMembership`] leaf — the LEAN-EMITTED wide 4-ary membership descriptor
//! (the SAME 8-felt `node8_4ary` recurrence the clear-side verifier walks) with a base trace
//! that climbs the path to the committed root, and the descriptor's sixteen public inputs
//! `[leaf0..7, root0..7]`. The turns fold via [`prove_turn_chain_recursive`] into one
//! `WholeChainProof`.
//!
//! ⚑ **The state-bound half is BLOCKED on a Lean-side PI-layout change** — the emitted
//! membership descriptor reserves no `[old8 ‖ new8]` door. See [`membership_leaf_bound`].
//!
//! ## What is private (honest scope)
//!
//! The played card IS revealed (a face-up play, as the game's Gift/Competition land on the
//! board), but the REST of the hand is not: the PIs carry only the blinded leaf commitment +
//! the hand root — the card ids are NOT in the proof, and the membership hides the other
//! cards (the path carries only sibling *hashes*). "Private-in-fold" here means exactly this:
//! the cards are not in the proof / public inputs, and data-availability + the membership
//! hide the hand. The deployed STARK is SUCCINCT, not zero-knowledge — true crypto-ZK (hiding
//! the transcript) is a separate, later concern. The named next phase is **Phase 4** (the
//! Lean refinement: the fold + the Witnessed lowering vs `MultiwayTug.lean`).
//!
//! ## The fold wiring (mirrors the audited deployed-custom-binding pattern)
//!
//! The per-turn leg minting (a wide `customVmDescriptor2R24` leg whose published
//! `custom_proof_commitment` is `custom_proof_pi_commitment([leaf, root])`, with the
//! re-provable membership witness retained prover-side) mirrors
//! `game-turn-slice/tests/game_turn_slice.rs`'s deployed template, specialized to the
//! membership leaf. A turn whose leg claims a commitment no verifying sub-proof backs is
//! UNSAT (no root) — so a forged match is rejected by the fold / light client.
