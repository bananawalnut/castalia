/// THE HARD GATE: a private multiway-tug match — TWO membership-proven plays (card A from the
/// full hand, then card B from the updated remaining hand, each proven under its own committed
/// root, the cards never revealed in the proof) — FOLDS via `prove_turn_chain_recursive` into
/// ONE `WholeChainProof` the pure light client `verify_history` ACCEPTS. Then a relabeled
/// `final_root` is REJECTED (a non-vacuous light-client bite), and the restored proof accepts.
// ⚑ BLOCKED, NOT SUPERSEDED — and the reasons below used to say the wrong one of those.
//
// MEASURED 2026-07-27 (435s, `--ignored`), both tests refuse at mint with the same text:
//
//   custom state-binding sub-proof leaf mint failed: the sub-program publishes 2 public
//   input(s), but the state-binding ABI requires at least 16 ([old_commit8 ‖ new_commit8] ‖
//   ..app). A program that cannot express the binding is refused rather than zero-padded into
//   a false one.
//
// That is the deployed custom state-binding node (`circuit/src/effect_vm/custom_state_binding.rs`)
// doing its job: these two fold 2-felt leaves (`[leaf, root]` / `[charm, winner]`) that PREDATE it.
//
// "SUPERSEDED" was wrong because what they cover is not covered elsewhere: both real-cell folds
// (`membership_play_folds_over_the_real_cell_and_lightclient_accepts` here, and
// `tests/fold_real_cell.rs`) fold ONE turn, and these are the only TWO-PLAY private match and the
// only win-output attestation over a hidden-hand play. Calling a hole a duplicate is how it stops
// being counted.
//
// The prefix machinery is NOT missing any more — the per-play membership leaf carries
// `[old8 ‖ new8]` over the real cell and is green (measured in the same run). THE RESIDUAL IS
// EXACTLY: drive TWO plays on the real `WorldCell` and fold their real-prefixed leaves, i.e. extend
// the green single-play real-cell body to a second turn. It is not a prover gap and not an ABI gap.
/// UNBLOCKED (2026-07-27) by doing the residual the note above names.
///
/// The old body lowered each play with `membership_leaf_for_play`, which
/// publishes 2 PIs (`[leaf, root]`), and the deployed state-binding node refuses
/// anything under 16 — correctly, since a 2-PI program cannot express
/// `[old8 ‖ new8]` and zero-padding it would be a FALSE binding rather than a
/// missing one. The residual was never a prover gap: `membership_leaf_bound`
/// already prefixes the real cell's rotated roots, and `fold_match_over_cell`
/// already chains N of them with the post→pre link check. It had **zero
/// callers**. This is the call.
///
/// So this is now what the note said it should be: TWO real membership plays,
/// each welded to the real `WorldCell`'s own rotated roots, each linking to the
/// next — the only two-play private match in the tree, and now the only one that
/// is welded to real state rather than the `pk[0]=7` fixture.
