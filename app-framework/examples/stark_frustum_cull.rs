//! `stark_frustum_cull` — frustum-culling the semantic graph with a **REAL STARK**, and
//! the **non-amplification proof obligation made concrete**: a darkened per-viewer
//! snapshot provably **cannot even prove** the fuller view.
//!
//! This is the sharper sibling of `examples/stark_rehydrate.rs`. That example shows a
//! STARK-gated snapshot re-expanding per-viewer (the root sees the full surface, a
//! weaker viewer a narrower one) and the anti-ghost teeth (a tampered PI 35, a foreign
//! descriptor, both rejected). This example presses on the ONE claim a screenshot of the
//! semantic graph has to earn to be more than a pretty lattice projection:
//!
//!   > A *darkened* frustum-snapshot — the per-viewer slice a weaker membrane re-expands —
//!   > carries a real STARK that attests **only the darkened endpoint**. Holding that
//!   > proof, the weaker viewer **cannot forge the fuller view**: there is no way to
//!   > present the darkened proof as a proof of the fuller surface's endpoint. You
//!   > provably cannot even *prove* the stronger view.
//!
//! ## Why this is "frustum culling the semantic graph", with teeth
//!
//! A graphics frustum cull throws away geometry outside the view volume; a deos
//! frustum-snapshot throws away the slice of the **semantic graph** the viewer's
//! capability does not admit. The novelty over a dead screenshot is that the surviving
//! slice re-expands into a *live, verifiable* interactive fragment. The novelty over a
//! mere cap-projection is the gate: the slice's faithfulness is a **STARK** of the turn
//! that produced it (Tier B), not a walk over a receipt log (Tier A). This example makes
//! the *cull itself non-amplifying in the proof system*:
//!
//!   - The **fuller** surface ends at endpoint commitment `Cfull` (PI 35 of its leg).
//!   - The **darkened** surface ends at a DIFFERENT endpoint commitment `Cdark` (PI 35
//!     of *its* leg) — a genuinely smaller state transition (a smaller debit).
//!   - The descriptor's in-circuit Poseidon2 hash sites FORCE PI 35 to be the genuine
//!     post-state commitment of whatever execution the proof witnesses. So the darkened
//!     proof can attest `Cdark` and ONLY `Cdark`. Splicing `Cfull` into the darkened
//!     proof's PI 35 and re-verifying is UNSAT — the exact shape of the anti-ghost
//!     tamper tooth, but here it is *the forgery of a stronger view* that it forecloses.
//!
//! Two independent walls therefore stand between the weaker viewer and the fuller view,
//! and we exhibit BOTH:
//!   (W1) the **STARK** wall — the darkened proof cannot be made to attest `Cfull`
//!        (`verify_stark_proof_against` rejects the spliced PI vector); and
//!   (W2) the **membrane** wall — the weaker holder's authority cannot project the
//!        fuller lineage at all (`is_attenuation` refuses; no projection is minted).
//! Either alone would suffice; together they are the non-amplification proof obligation,
//! concrete and runnable.
//!
//! Everything load-bearing is an EXISTING function composed, nothing reinvented:
//!   - `mint_transfer_leg` (mints a real rotated `Ir2BatchProof` over genuine cells),
//!   - `StarkSnapshot` / `rehydrate_for` (the frustum-snapshot + per-viewer membrane),
//!   - `verify_stark_leg` / `verify_stark_proof_against` (the Lean-free STARK verify),
//!   - `Membrane` + `dregg_cell::is_attenuation` (the real cap lattice),
//!   - `EmbeddedExecutor` (a real committed turn supplies the surface state).
//!
//! Run it:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo run -p dregg-app-framework --example stark_frustum_cull
//! ```
//!
//! It narrates, mints + verifies TWO real STARKs, exhibits the two non-amplification
//! walls, and exits 0 iff every prove→verify and every must-reject landed as designed.
