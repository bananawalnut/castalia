//! STARK-gated rehydration — a frustum-snapshot whose re-expansion is gated by a
//! **real STARK proof**, NOT by a witness-replay over the receipt chain.
//!
//! ## The contrast this module draws (the whole point)
//!
//! [`crate::rehydration`] ships the deos frustum-snapshot today: a [`Sturdyref`]
//! carries an [`InteractionLog`], and its liveness-type is DERIVED by *walking* that
//! log — [`InteractionLog::all_witnessed`] checks every interaction carries a genuine
//! `turn_hash` (a receipt present in the witness-graph). That is **Tier A**
//! (`docs/deos/DEOS-APPS.md` §"the two tiers"): tamper-evidence by **witness replay**
//! — the rehydrator re-walks the receipt chain and trusts that the receipts attest the
//! turns.
//!
//! This module is **Tier B**: the snapshot carries a *real STARK proof* of the turn
//! that produced the surface state, and rehydration **VERIFIES the STARK** instead of
//! walking a log. Opening the image proves "this surface state is the genuine endpoint
//! of a verified turn-history" the way a **light client** does — it checks one proof,
//! it does not re-execute or re-walk anything. A tampered surface state, a forged
//! proof, or a proof against the wrong post-state is **rejected at rehydration**: the
//! STARK verify fails closed.
//!
//! The proof artifact is the **rotated multi-table `Ir2BatchProof`** (the leaf the
//! whole-chain IVC fold builds on) minted by
//! [`dregg_turn::rotation_witness::mint_rotated_participant_leg`] over the *executor's
//! genuine before/after cells*. Its public inputs carry the rotated Poseidon2
//! state-commitments at PI 34/35 ([`RotatedParticipantLeg::old_root`] /
//! [`RotatedParticipantLeg::new_root`]); the descriptor's in-circuit hash sites force
//! PI 35 to be the genuine post-state commitment, so a claimed NEW_COMMIT with no
//! satisfying execution is UNSAT. Verification is
//! [`dregg_circuit::descriptor_ir2::verify_vm_descriptor2`] — the **Lean-free** verify
//! surface (`dregg-circuit`'s `verifier` feature compiles it without the prover/DFT),
//! and it is **seconds-scale** for a single turn (the multi-turn `WholeChainProof`
//! ROOT — see [`stark_chain_snapshot`] — is the minutes-scale light-client artifact the
//! same weld extends to).
//!
//! ## What stays the same (the per-viewer jail)
//!
//! The membrane is *unchanged*. A [`StarkSnapshot`] still re-expands per-viewer through
//! the REAL [`crate::rehydration::Membrane`] / [`dregg_cell::is_attenuation`] lattice: a powerful
//! holder's snapshot yields a NARROWER surface to a weaker viewer, an incomparable
//! identity cannot peek. Swapping the *tamper-evidence mechanism* (witness-replay →
//! STARK) does not loosen the *confinement* (the cap-membrane) — the two are
//! orthogonal, exactly as `DEOS.md` separates them.
//!
//! ## Runnable demos
//!
//! Two `examples/` binaries exercise this module end to end against the REAL prover +
//! verifier (`cargo run -p dregg-app-framework --example <name>`):
//!   - **`stark_rehydrate`** — the Tier-A-vs-Tier-B narration: a snapshot carries a real
//!     STARK and rehydration VERIFIES it (light-client style), per-viewer, with the
//!     tampered-PI-35 / wrong-descriptor anti-ghost teeth.
//!   - **`stark_frustum_cull`** — the **non-amplification proof obligation made
//!     concrete**: it mints TWO real legs (a fuller endpoint and a *darkened* one) and
//!     shows the weaker viewer holding the darkened proof provably **cannot prove the
//!     fuller view** — splicing the fuller PI-35 commitment into the darkened proof is
//!     UNSAT ([`verify_stark_proof_against`] rejects), AND the membrane independently
//!     refuses to project the fuller lineage
//!     ([`crate::rehydration::RehydrateError::Amplification`]). Two independent walls =
//!     "frustum culling the semantic graph" with teeth.
