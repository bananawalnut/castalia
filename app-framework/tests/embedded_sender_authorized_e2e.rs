//! End-to-end keystone: `SenderAuthorized { PublicRoot }` ENFORCES FOR REAL
//! through the embedded executor, on the honest fire path — not fail-closed.
//!
//! This is the proof that the real STARK-backed `MerkleMembership` verifier is
//! wired into `EmbeddedExecutor`'s underlying `dregg_sdk::AgentRuntime` BY
//! DEFAULT, so an honest issuer turn is genuinely ACCEPTED and a non-member's
//! turn is genuinely REFUSED — at the Poseidon2 / STARK level, not by an
//! executor-side field compare and not by a fail-closed reject-everything stub.
//!
//! The chain under test:
//!
//!   1. A cell carries `StateConstraint::SenderAuthorized { PublicRoot { slot } }`.
//!   2. `slot` is seeded with `single_member_authorized_root(member_pk)` — the
//!      32-byte LE root of the trivial one-leaf Poseidon2 tree whose sole member
//!      is `member_pk` (the honest single-issuer authorized set).
//!   3. A state-changing turn (`Effect::SetField` on a free slot) attaches a
//!      `WitnessKind::MerklePath` blob carrying
//!      `single_member_membership_proof(member_pk)`.
//!   4. The executor builds a `WitnessBundle` from `action.witness_blobs` + its
//!      `witnessed_registry` (the REAL one, by default) and feeds the proof to
//!      `MerkleMembershipStarkVerifier`. The candidate the verifier checks is the
//!      TARGET CELL's public key (`EvalContext.sender`).
//!
//! Because the verifier compresses the candidate pk to the membership leaf and
//! checks a genuine Poseidon2 Merkle path to the slot's root, only a cell whose
//! pk is actually the set member passes — a different signer (non-member) is
//! rejected even if it presents the member's own valid proof (the proof binds
//! the member's leaf, not the candidate's).
//!
//! Encoding convention (shared prover/verifier, see
//! `dregg_turn::executor::membership_verifier`):
//!   * leaf  = `compress(pk)` = `Poseidon2::hash_many(BabyBear::encode_hash(pk))`
//!   * root  = `root_felt_from_slot(slot)` = the felt in the slot's low 4 LE bytes
//!   * tree  = single member at position 0 of a depth-2 zero-sibling-padded tree;
//!            `single_member_authorized_root` and `single_member_membership_proof`
//!            are both derived from that one tree so they are mutually consistent.
